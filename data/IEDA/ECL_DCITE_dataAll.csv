100494.xml,/resource/descriptions/description,"This data set archives several years data of flow-through column experiments exploring the largely unknown effects of mineral spatial distribution on dissolution rates using columns packed with the same magnesite mass but with different distributions within a quartz matrix. Variables include the spatial distribution of the reactive mineral magnesite, orientation of the magnesite zone to the main flow direction, length scale, flow rates, and size contrast between magnesite and quartz grains. The columns with lengths varying from 5 to 22 cm were flushed with acidic solutions (pH 4.0) at flow velocities varying from 0.015 to 7.2 m/d. The largest rate difference was observed between a Mixed column containing uniformly distributed magnesite and a One-zone column containing magnesite in one cylindrical zone in the center of the column (flow-parallel One-zone column). Breakthrough data show that the zonation in the One-zone columns, especially when the grain sizes of magnesite are smaller than that of the quartz, limits magnesite dissolution by a factor of 1.5 4.0 compared to the Mixed column. The magnitude of the rate difference increases with increasing flow rates. Under low flow rate conditions, the pore fluids reach chemical equilibrium and reaction kinetics does not play an important role. For those conditions, the mineral distribution does not make a difference. Under high flow conditions, however, the effects of the mineral distribution are maximized because column-scale rates exhibit kinetic control due to low residence times. The rate differences between the Mixed and the flow-parallel One-zone cases are much larger than the 14% maximum difference observed between the Mixed column and the flow-perpendicular One-zone column. Thedata set identifies general principles that govern mineral dissolution rates in heterogeneous porous media. It will advance our models of the multi-component geochemical reactions in natural, heterogeneous porous media and will provide valuable insights on the laboratory-field rate discrepancy."

100509.xml,/resource/descriptions/description,"This data set examines the largely unexplored role of illite spatial distribution patterns in dictating sorption of Cr(VI). Flow-through experiments were carried out at 0.6, 3.0 and 15.0 m/day using columns packed with the same illite and quartz mass however with different patterns and permeability contrasts. Column-scale sorption macrocapacity and macrorates were found to decrease with transport connectivity, a quantitative measure of heterogeneity characteristics. At 0.6 and 3.0 m/day, well-connected low permeability illite zones oriented in the flow-parallel direction leads to diffusion-controlled mass transport limitation to access sorption sites, leading to up to 1.4 order of magnitude lower macrocapacity and macrorates compared to those in minimally-connected columns with well-mixed illite and quartz. Insights gained here bridge gaps between laboratory and field application, advance predictive understanding of reactive transport processes in natural heterogeneous subsurface."

Spivack, Steven D'Hondt, Robert A. Pockalny took place in October-December 2014 and had as primary goal to collect sedimentary pore water from a series of sites in the North Atlantic and determine if these samples can be used to (1) document how deep Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AOM) of the last glacial maximum differed from that of the present, and (2) directly test the influence of last glacial maximum AMOC on atmospheric CO2 (via the pre-formed NO3- content of deep and intermediate water in the LGM North Atlantic). Measurement of dissolved oxygen at the studied sites are an important piece of information to meet these objectives. Oxygen measurements were performed at 9 sites across the North Atlantic, on 6 Multicores, 8 Gravity cores, and 9 Long Cores using an optical O2 sensor (PreSens MICROX TX3) . This dataset is presented here."

The region is host to three major low-angle structures, the Castle Cliffs, Tule Springs, and Mormon Peak detachments, whose origin and role in regional extension are vigorously debated. We analyzed 36 samples collected from Precambrian basement gneisses and Paleozoic to Jurassic siltstones and sandstones exposed in the footwalls of these detachments. Samples from the Beaver Dam and Mormon mountains were collected earlier by Stockli (1999); samples from the Tule Springs Hills were collected during the course of this study."

Measurements include temperature, pH, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon, and arsenic speciation. Arsenic speciation includes arsenic as arsenite, arsenite, monomethylarsonate, dimethylarsinate, and total arsenic. These data were collected as part of an investigation to characterize the role of microorganisms and aquifer chemistry in arsenic speciation and cycling."

100534.xml,/resource/descriptions/description,"We present version 4 of a database for Central American volcanic rocks and related components with more precise locations than version 3. The Rutgers University Central American Geochemical data (RU_CAGeochem) includes the active volcanoes related to the Cocos-Caribbean convergent plate boundary that extends from Guatemala to Costa Rica in Central America. The RU prefix signifies that the data and/or samples are primarily from the long-term Central American research project started at Dartmouth College in 1970 and continued at Rutgers University between 1974 to the present. The database is decidedly uneven because of the impressive improvement of analytical techniques during the period of sample and data production. Further complications arise because most of the sampling and analysis were part of the educational process for many different undergraduate and graduate students using different types of instruments. This note presents, as a reasonably coherent whole, geochemical data and metadata for about 1325 samples collected by at least 40 students and colleagues. Many new Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic ratios are included here but most of the new data are metadata that provide greatly improved descriptions of the locations and status of the samples as well as estimates of data quality. Sample locations in .kml format and additional descriptive material are available at companion dataset 'Central America Volcanoes: Cerro Negro, Ilopango, Irazu, Telica, and Turrialba' by M. Carr, http://dx.doi.org/10.1594/IEDA/100404. This version contains descriptions of the isotope standardizations and the integers used in the data quality column. These begin at rows 90 and 100, respectively in the RU_CAGeochem Notes tab."

EarthCube is a joint effort by the National Science Foundations Geosciences Directorate (NSF GEO) and Office of Cyberinfrastructure (NSF OCI) to create a framework to understand and predict responses of the Earth as a system from the space-atmosphere boundary to the core, including the influences of humans and ecosystems. EarthCube is also part of CIF21 (Cyberinfrastructure for the 21st Century). It is a knowledge management infrastructure for integrating geosciences data openly, transparently, and inclusively, using cyberinfrastructure derived from and governed by the Geosciences community. EarthCube is intended to connect layers of data and information through data curation and management via interface layers, and support knowledge creation through data-enabled science. These are social science survey data, which is only one (and one of the least common) of the many types of geoscience data."

100540.xml,/resource/descriptions/description,"Eleven microinclusion-bearing fibrous diamonds from the Fox kimberlite, Ekati mine, Northwest Territories, with either coated or cubic-like morphologies were analyzed for their major and trace element and Sr isotopic compositions. High-density fluid (HDF) microinclusions of saline compositions were found in 9 of the diamonds and silicic compositions in 2 diamonds. Some of the saline diamonds encapsulate also micro-mineral inclusions of their peridotite host rock (olivine, orthopyroxene, Cr-diopside and chromite); the silicic diamonds contain microinclusions of omphacitic clinopyroxene and are related to eclogite host. Both saline and silicic HDFs are enriched in incompatible elements; they have fractionated REE patterns with elevated Ba, U, Th and LREE but depleted Nb, Ta and alkalis (K, Rb, and Cs). The fractionated nature of these patterns are more pronounced in the saline HDFs, which are also characterized with positive Eu- and Sr-anomalies versus no Eu anomaly and negative Sr anomalies in the silicic fluids. 87Sr/86Sri in the saline HDFs are 0.7039-0.7090 compared to 0.7064 and 0.7111 in the two diamonds with silicic fluids. Also provided, the trace element composition of one diamonds from the Diavik mine, Canada."

Sediment cores were taken at thirteen sites across the equatorial Pacific and the North Pacific Gyre. Knowledge of the chemical composition of the porewater throughout the collected cores is fundamental to answer the driving research questions of this scientific expedition. The shipboard geochemistry laboratory generated interstitial waters by squeezing 597 individual samples, and by extracting an additional 153 solutions by Rhizon sampling. Due to the time needed to analyze this very high number of samples, not all were analyzed for each dissolved constituent.

100564.xml,/resource/descriptions/description,"The KN195-03 research cruise on board the R/V Knorr (Chief scientist Steven D'Hondt) took place in January-February 2009 and had as primary objective to test and refine quantitative models for the magnitude and geographic distribution of subseafloor biomass and organic-fueled subseafloor respiration. Sediment cores were taken at thirteen sites across the equatorial Pacific and the North Pacific Gyre. Knowledge of the chemical composition of the porewater throughout the collected cores is fundamental to answer the driving research questions of this scientific expedition. The shipboard geochemistry laboratory generated interstitial waters by squeezing 597 individual samples, and by extracting an additional 153 solutions by Rhizon sampling. Due to the time needed to analyze this very high number of samples, not all were analyzed for each dissolved constituent. We present here the shipboard porewater chloride concentration dataset measured by ion chromatography."

100586.xml,/resource/descriptions/description,"East African climate change since the late Miocene consisted of persistent shorter-term, orbital-scale wet-dry cycles superimposed upon a long-term trend towards more open, grassy landscapes. Either or both of these modes of paleoclimate variability may have influenced East African mammalian evolution, yet the interrelationship between these secular and orbital paleoclimate signals remains poorly understood. Here, we explore whether the long-term secular climate change was accompanied by significant changes at the orbital-scale as well. We develop Northeast African hydroclimate and vegetation proxy data for two 100 kyr-duration windows near 3.05 Ma and 1.75 Ma at ODP Site 967 in the eastern Mediterranean basin where sedimentation is dominated by eastern Sahara dust input and Nile River runoff. These two windows were selected because they have comparable orbital configurations and bracket an important increase in East African C4 grasslands. We conducted high-resolution (2.5 kyr sampling) multiproxy biomarker, H- and C-isotopic analyses of plant waxes and lignin phenols to document orbital-scale changes in hydrology, vegetation, and woody cover for these to intervals. Both intervals are dominated by large-amplitude, precession-scale (~20-kyr) changes in Northeast African vegetation and rainfall/runoff. The _13Cwax values and lignin phenol composition record a variable but consistently C4 grass-dominated ecosystem for both intervals (50-80% C4). Precessional _Dwax cycles were approximately 20-30 in peak-to-peak amplitude, comparable to other _Dwax records of the early Holocene African humid period. There were no significant differences in the means or variances of the _Dwax or _13Cwax data for the 3.05 Ma and 1.75 Ma intervals studied, suggesting that the paleohydrology and paleovegetation responses to precessional forcing were similar for these two periods. These results suggest that the eastern Sahara did not experience the significant increase in C4 vegetation that has been observed in East Africa over this time period. This observation is consistent with a proposed mechanism of East African climate change whereby regional precipitation was reduced in response to the emergence of modern zonal tropical SST gradients between 3-2 Ma."

100589.xml,/resource/descriptions/description,"This dataset presents in situ (LA-ICPMS; down to a 10 micron beam size) major, minor, PGEs and chalcophile elements on sulfides from five partially serpentinized peridotites from the St. Elena ophiolite, Costa Rica. PGE-Re concentrations in sulfides (dominant petlandites) are highly variable, ranging from 1 100,000 times that of primitive mantle (PM). PM-normalized PGE-Re patterns in the sulfides are dominated by strong Pt depletions relative to Os, Ir, Ru and Pd. Pb concentrations average around 2.7 ppm."
