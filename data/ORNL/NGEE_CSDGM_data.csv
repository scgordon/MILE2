NGEE,CSDGM,ftp___ngee.ornl.gov_data_outgoing_metadata_Active_Layer_Soil_Carbon_and_Nitrogen_Mineralization_Barrow_Alaska_2012.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"This data set consists of bulk soil characteristics as well as carbon and nutrient mineralization rates of active layer soils manually collected from the field in August, 2012, frozen, and then thawed and incubated across a range of temperatures in the laboratory for 28 day periods in 2013-2015. The soils were collected from four replicate polygons each in areas A-D of Intensive Site 1 at the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE) Arctic site near Barrow, Alaska, in center, edge, and trough microtopography in each polygon. Data included are i) bulk soil characteristics including carbon, nitrogen, gravimetric water content, bulk density, and pH in 5-cm depth increments and also by soil horizon, ii) carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus mineralization rates for soil horizons incubated aerobically (and in one case both aerobically and anaerobically) for 28 days at temperatures that included 2, 4, 8, and 12 degrees C. http://dx.doi.org/10.5440/1185213&#xD; &#xD; [These data are a portion of a larger dataset. Additional soil and incubation data are forthcoming when published as part of another paper that includes additional replicate analyses. 2015/10/29]"

NGEE,CSDGM,ftp___ngee.ornl.gov_data_outgoing_metadata_Active_Layer_Soil_Carbon_and_Nitrogen_Mineralization_Barrow_Alaska_2012.xml,Lineage Statement,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"both At peak growing season in late July, 2012, we manually collected soil cores to the permafrost boundary across gradients of polygonal tundra and microtopographic position on the Barrow Environmental Observatory. Soil samples were collected using a 5.08-cm diameter hammer corer or a tundra knife (to sample 10 cm by 10 cm soil columns) when soil was too wet to retrieve an intact soil sample. Cores were collected in each of four polygon types (poorly defined, low, flat, and high-centered), from the trough, edge, or center microtopographic locations within each polygon (n = 4 polygon types by 4 replicate polygons of each type by 3 microtopographic positions = 48 total soil cores). Upon removal from the soil, the depth of the organic layer was determined as the boundary where soil became largely mineral in texture. The cores were then sectioned into 5 cm increments, placed in separate bags, and kept on blue ice while in the field. When the organic/mineral transition fell within a 5 cm increment, the organic matter and mineral soil were treated separately. Cores were frozen at -20 degrees C before shipping to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where they were frozen at -20 degrees C until processing. &#xD; &#xD; Given the large number of soil depth increments, processing and month-long soil incubations were performed serially on each replicate polygon (in January 2013, June and September of 2014, and January 2015). For each replicate, core increments were first thawed overnight at 4 degrees C,then plant material (green moss, fine roots, and rhizomes) was removed and soils were homogenized by hand (organic horizons) or by sieving the soil through an 8-mm sieve (mineral horizons). The 5-cm depth increments were subsampled for a series of soil characteristics. One subsample was used to determine pH using 1:4 or 1:2 ratios of field-moist soil to distilled water for organic and mineral soils, respectively (Beckman 350 pH Meter, Fullerton, CA). A second subsample was used for determination of initial extractable ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate by shaking a 1:10 ratio of field-moist soil to 2 M KCl for 1 hour at low speed on a reciprocal shaker. After settling overnight at 4 degrees C, the extractant was filtered through Whatman No.1 filter papers pre-leached with distilled water and frozen at -20 degrees C until analysis for nitrogen and phosphorus on an autoanalyzer (Lachat QuickChem QC8500 Automated Ion Analyzer, Loveland, CO). A third subsample was used to determine soil gravimetric water content by drying the soil to a constant mass (3 days) at 70 degrees C. Dried gravimetric water content samples were ground to a fine powder (SPEX SamplePrep 2010 Geno/Grinder, Metuchen, NJ), re-dried, and carbon and nitrogen content were determined on an elemental analyzer (Costech ECS 4010 Elemental Analyzer, Valencia, CA).&#xD; To assess soil C and nutrient mineralization response to warming, we incubated soils from three horizons at three temperatures for 28 days. After initial subsamples were complete, we combined 5-cm depth increments into soil horizons: organic, mineral, and deep organic (DO) defined as organic-rich soil near the permafrost boundary. We re-sampled these soils for initial horizon pH, nitrogen and phosphorus, gravimetric water content, and carbon and nitrogen as described above, and then approximately 5 g of soil were sealed into 160-ml serum bottles, which were flushed with compressed air to ensure at least 6 cycles of gas through the headspace. Air filled serum bottles served as blanks (6 bottles per replicate) and were incubated with the samples (2 bottles per temperature treatment). (Note: the first replicate in January 2013 was incubated both aerobically and anaerobically; the anaerobic incubations were flushed with nitrogen gas rather than compressed air.). Bottles were then stored in incubators (Thermo Scientific Precision Model 815 Incubator, Marietta, OH) held at a constant temperature of 4, 8 or 12 degrees C. The bottles were sampled on days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 of the incubation via gas chromatography (SRI Instruments Greenhouse Gas GC System with 8610C Chassis, Torrance CA). A 1 ml syringe was inserted to the septum and the plunger was pumped vigorously to ensure the air within the bottle was mixed uniformly. A fixed volume of sample (0.4 ml) was injected into the gas chromatograph and the methane and carbon dioxide peak areas were recorded. Samples were then flushed with air for 6 cycles and returned to the incubators. For each day of gas chromatography sampling, a set of carbon dioxide (and methane, for anaerobic incubations) standards was run to create a standard curve between carbon content and peak area. Following gas chromatograph injection on day 28, the bottle seals were broken, and soil was subsampled for pH, extractable ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate using methods described above. &#xD; &#xD; Carbon mineralization rate was calculated (in both microgram C g soil-1 hour-1 and microgram C g C-1 hour-1) for both the incubation time between each sampling day and the total mineralization over the 28 day study. Nutrient mineralization rate was calculated (microgram nutrient g soil day-1) as the difference between initial and final nutrient content, standardized for soil dry weight. These data correspond to a data file provided for data submitted for two publications (Treat et al., 2015 and Schadel et al., 2015) that focused solely on carbon cycling, with specific parameters of interest, and included only one replicate each of the full data set collected in this effort. These data will be updated and additional categories will become available for the full data set (e.g., ammonification, nitrification, and phosphorus mineralization rates and initial pool sizes). &#xD; &#xD; Treat, C.C., S.M.

NGEE,CSDGM,ftp___ngee.ornl.gov_data_outgoing_metadata_Active_Layer_Soil_Carbon_and_Nitrogen_Mineralization_Barrow_Alaska_2012.xml,Purpose,/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose,"Atmospheric warming, which is expected to occur more rapidly in the Arctic compared with lower-latitudes, may lead to permafrost degradation, potentially increasing feedbacks of carbon (C) to the atmosphere, and increased nutrient availability for plants. While C stored in permafrost has been the focus of much research, we were interested in feedbacks from warming of the active layer that thaws each year. Microbial processing of organic matter in the active layer is controlled by the balance among soil organic matter content, moisture, and temperature, which are influenced by landscape position and plant community composition. We collected active layer soil across a gradient of microtopographic positions in polygonal tundra in Barrow, Alaska. We hypothesized that C, N, and P mineralization would be greatest in the warmest soils with the greatest soil organic matter content."
NGEE,CSDGM,ftp___ngee.ornl.gov_data_outgoing_metadata_Active_Layer_Soil_Carbon_and_Nitrogen_Mineralization_Barrow_Alaska_2012.xml,Quality Statement,/metadata/dataqual,"We have not conducted uncertainty analyses, but we have completed quality assurance/control checks. These data have also been used in wider meta-analyses, and have been compared against other sites. Three of us checked the data in the electronic file against the raw data sheets. Some data are missing due to sample loss at time of field collection, or due to laboratory mishap. These cells were left blank. both At peak growing season in late July, 2012, we manually collected soil cores to the permafrost boundary across gradients of polygonal tundra and microtopographic position on the Barrow Environmental Observatory. Soil samples were collected using a 5.08-cm diameter hammer corer or a tundra knife (to sample 10 cm by 10 cm soil columns) when soil was too wet to retrieve an intact soil sample. Cores were collected in each of four polygon types (poorly defined, low, flat, and high-centered), from the trough, edge, or center microtopographic locations within each polygon (n = 4 polygon types by 4 replicate polygons of each type by 3 microtopographic positions = 48 total soil cores). Upon removal from the soil, the depth of the organic layer was determined as the boundary where soil became largely mineral in texture. The cores were then sectioned into 5 cm increments, placed in separate bags, and kept on blue ice while in the field. When the organic/mineral transition fell within a 5 cm increment, the organic matter and mineral soil were treated separately. Cores were frozen at -20 degrees C before shipping to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where they were frozen at -20 degrees C until processing. &#xD; &#xD; Given the large number of soil depth increments, processing and month-long soil incubations were performed serially on each replicate polygon (in January 2013, June and September of 2014, and January 2015). For each replicate, core increments were first thawed overnight at 4 degrees C,then plant material (green moss, fine roots, and rhizomes) was removed and soils were homogenized by hand (organic horizons) or by sieving the soil through an 8-mm sieve (mineral horizons). The 5-cm depth increments were subsampled for a series of soil characteristics. One subsample was used to determine pH using 1:4 or 1:2 ratios of field-moist soil to distilled water for organic and mineral soils, respectively (Beckman 350 pH Meter, Fullerton, CA). A second subsample was used for determination of initial extractable ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate by shaking a 1:10 ratio of field-moist soil to 2 M KCl for 1 hour at low speed on a reciprocal shaker. After settling overnight at 4 degrees C, the extractant was filtered through Whatman No.1 filter papers pre-leached with distilled water and frozen at -20 degrees C until analysis for nitrogen and phosphorus on an autoanalyzer (Lachat QuickChem QC8500 Automated Ion Analyzer, Loveland, CO). A third subsample was used to determine soil gravimetric water content by drying the soil to a constant mass (3 days) at 70 degrees C. Dried gravimetric water content samples were ground to a fine powder (SPEX SamplePrep 2010 Geno/Grinder, Metuchen, NJ), re-dried, and carbon and nitrogen content were determined on an elemental analyzer (Costech ECS 4010 Elemental Analyzer, Valencia, CA).&#xD; To assess soil C and nutrient mineralization response to warming, we incubated soils from three horizons at three temperatures for 28 days. After initial subsamples were complete, we combined 5-cm depth increments into soil horizons: organic, mineral, and deep organic (DO) defined as organic-rich soil near the permafrost boundary. We re-sampled these soils for initial horizon pH, nitrogen and phosphorus, gravimetric water content, and carbon and nitrogen as described above, and then approximately 5 g of soil were sealed into 160-ml serum bottles, which were flushed with compressed air to ensure at least 6 cycles of gas through the headspace. Air filled serum bottles served as blanks (6 bottles per replicate) and were incubated with the samples (2 bottles per temperature treatment). (Note: the first replicate in January 2013 was incubated both aerobically and anaerobically; the anaerobic incubations were flushed with nitrogen gas rather than compressed air.). Bottles were then stored in incubators (Thermo Scientific Precision Model 815 Incubator, Marietta, OH) held at a constant temperature of 4, 8 or 12 degrees C. The bottles were sampled on days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 of the incubation via gas chromatography (SRI Instruments Greenhouse Gas GC System with 8610C Chassis, Torrance CA). A 1 ml syringe was inserted to the septum and the plunger was pumped vigorously to ensure the air within the bottle was mixed uniformly. A fixed volume of sample (0.4 ml) was injected into the gas chromatograph and the methane and carbon dioxide peak areas were recorded. Samples were then flushed with air for 6 cycles and returned to the incubators. For each day of gas chromatography sampling, a set of carbon dioxide (and methane, for anaerobic incubations) standards was run to create a standard curve between carbon content and peak area. Following gas chromatograph injection on day 28, the bottle seals were broken, and soil was subsampled for pH, extractable ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate using methods described above. &#xD; &#xD; Carbon mineralization rate was calculated (in both microgram C g soil-1 hour-1 and microgram C g C-1 hour-1) for both the incubation time between each sampling day and the total mineralization over the 28 day study. Nutrient mineralization rate was calculated (microgram nutrient g soil day-1) as the difference between initial and final nutrient content, standardized for soil dry weight. These data correspond to a data file provided for data submitted for two publications (Treat et al., 2015 and Schadel et al., 2015) that focused solely on carbon cycling, with specific parameters of interest, and included only one replicate each of the full data set collected in this effort.

This dataset contains shell scripts to create the CLM-PFLOTRAN cases, specific input files for PFLOTRAN and CLM, outputs, and python scripts to make the figures using the outputs in the publication. Through these results, we demonstrate that CLM-PFLOTRAN can approximately reproduce CLM results in selected cases for the Arctic, temperate and tropic sites. In addition, the new framework facilitates mechanistic representations of soil biogeochemistry processes in the land surface model."

Each column was used in a coupled calibration to identify moss, peat and mineral soil hydrothermal properties to be used in up-scaled simulations. Observational soil temperature data from a tundra site located near Barrow, AK (Area C) is used to calibrate thermal properties of moss, peat, and sandy loam soil to be used in the multiphysics Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS) models. Simulation results are a list of calibrated hydrothermal parameters for moss, peat, and mineral soil hydrothermal parameters. http://dx.doi.org/10.5440/1167674"

We conducted an 15N isotope tracer experiment to assess the vertical distribution of nutrient acquisition&#xD; among three dominant species representing important plant functional types (PFTs) on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) in Barrow, Alaska. We found that vertical patterns of root distribution and nutrient acquisition varied among plant species, and that root density may not entirely explain patterns of nutrient acquisition for all species. &#xD; &#xD; This is preliminary metadata with more information and data to come."

Measurements were made at 82 plots across various polygon geomorphic classes at research sites on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO), the Biocomplexity Experiment site on the BEO, and the International Biological Program (IBP) site a little west of the BEO. ArcView GIS files available of the Land Cover Type Classifications. Dataset doi:10.5440/1156852&#xD; &#xD; This product is a compilation of data from 27 plots as presented in Lara et al. (2012), data from six plots presented in Olivas et al. (2010); and from 49 plots described in (Lara et al. 2014). Measurements were made during the peak of the growing seasons during 2006 to 2010.&#xD; &#xD; At each of the measurement plots (except Olivas et al., 2010) four different thicknesses of shade cloth were used to generate CO2 light response curves. Light response curves were used to normalize photosynthetically active radiation that is diurnally variable to a peak growing season average ~400 umolm-2sec-1. At the Olivas et al. (2010) plots, diurnal patterns were characterized by repeated sampling. CO2 measurements were made using a closed-chamber photosynthesis system and CH4 measurements were made using a photo-acoustic multi-gas analyzer.&#xD; &#xD; In addition, plot-level measurements for thaw depth (TD), water table depth (WTD), leaf area index (LAI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are summarized by geomorphic polygon type.&#xD; &#xD; Lara et al. 2014&#xD; Lara MJ, McGuire AD, Euskirchen ES, Tweedie CE, Hinkel KM, Skurikhin AN, Romanovsky VE, Grosse G, Bolton WR, Genet H (2014) Polygonal tundra geomorphological change in response to warming alters future CO2 and CH4 flux on the Barrow Peninsula.

This study describes the first comprehensive spatial examination of active layer biogeochemistry that extends across high- and low-centered polygons and their features, including depth. Water chemistry measurements were made on active layer water samples collected near Barrow, Alaska during summer, 2012. Several significant differences in chemistry were observed between high- and low-centered polygons suggesting polygon types may be useful for landscape-scale geochemical classification. However, differences were found for polygon features (centers and troughs) for analytes that were not significant for type, suggesting that finer scale features control biogeochemistry in a different way than polygon type. Depth variations were also significant, demonstrating important multi-dimensional aspects of polygonal ground biogeochemistry. These results have major implications for understanding how polygonal ground ecosystems function, and how they may respond to future change. DOI 10.5440/1164833; http://dx.doi.org/10.5440/1164833."

Wendy Ryan 05-2008 Evaluation of Ultrasonic Snow Depth Sensors for U.S. Snow Measurements http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/2007JTECHA947.1 Data is retrieved hourly over local Barrow radio network Over the course of the winter the data is passively monitored for sensor failure. At the end of the snow season data is processed. 5 minute distance data is converted to snow depth. Using a data visualization utility in sliding 1 to 2 day increments the data is viewed and outliers / extraneous data noise are removed from the 5 minute stream. Once the entire snow season has been viewed, filtered, and approved as quality data, a one hour and 3 hour moving average is applied. In 2014 an additional parameter was added to the 2013-2014 data set, estimated snow depth.

Cores were drilled along different transects to sample polygonal features (i.e. the trough, center and rim of high, transitional and low center polygons). Most cores were drilled around 1 meter in depth and a few deep cores were drilled around 3 meters in depth. Three-dimensional images of the frozen cores were constructed using a medical X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner. TIFF files can be uploaded to ImageJ (an open-source imaging software) to examine soil structure and densities within each core. doi:10.5440/1170517; http://dx.doi.org/10.5440/1170517"

One mission was flown. The LiDAR data for this project was collected with the Aerometric Leica ALS-70 LiDAR system. All flight planning and acquisition was completed using Leica FPES. Aerometric used the following sensor acquisition settings. The flight altitude (above ground level) was 700 meters, laser pulse rate was 350 kHz, mirror scan frequency was 58 Hz, scan angle (+/-) was 40 degrees, side lap was 50 %, and ground speed was 150 kts.&#xD; The LiDAR data for this project was acquired in one mission. Airborne GPS and IMU data was collected during acquisition for use in determining the sensor's position. The mission included the acquisition of all planned project lines and cross flights. The cross flights were flown perpendicular to the planned flight lines and their data used in the in-situ calibration of the sensor. The mission was processed using Leica IPAS-TC software to determine both the airborne GNSS trajectory, and the blending of inertial data. Aerometric operated a GPS base station on location during the acquisition of this data. The position of the base station and raw GPS data were computed by Aerometric for use in processing.&#xD; The airborne GNSS/IMU post processed data along with the LiDAR raw measurements were processed using Leica IPAS-TC 3.1. This software was used to match the raw LiDAR measurements with the computed positions and attitudes of the LiDAR sensor. The result was a point cloud of LiDAR measured points referenced to the ground control system. One LAS 1.2 file was generated per flightline. We used 285 checkpoints acquired by UMIAQ to compute the vertical accuracy. The computed RMSE at the 95th percentile confidence interval was 0.143 meters, meeting the general LiDAR data vertical accuracy specifications. A mosaic was created using the 142 geotiff files produced by Aerometric to create a single 0.25 horizontal resolution DEM dataset. 20151020"

The coordinate system, datum, and geoid for this DEM are UTM Zone 4N, NAD83 (2011), NAVD88 (GEOID09). Aerometric provided further QC procedures involving the comparison of LiDAR data points with field-survey data to remove any atmospheric bias encountered during data collection. This process involves statistically comparing the LiDAR "bare-earth" surface to collected ground survey data, determining and applying a vertical offset, and generating final statistics to determine the vertical accuracy of the data. Contact data PI to obtain Aerometric statistical summary of the vertical accuracy results [file: Barrow_LiDAR_Vertical_Accuracy_Results.xls]. No data missing. field LiDAR data acquisition was completed on July 12, 2013. One mission was flown. The LiDAR data for this project was collected with the Aerometric Leica ALS-70 LiDAR system. All flight planning and acquisition was completed using Leica FPES. Aerometric used the following sensor acquisition settings. The flight altitude (above ground level) was 700 meters, laser pulse rate was 350 kHz, mirror scan frequency was 58 Hz, scan angle (+/-) was 40 degrees, side lap was 50 %, and ground speed was 150 kts.&#xD; The LiDAR data for this project was acquired in one mission. Airborne GPS and IMU data was collected during acquisition for use in determining the sensor's position. The mission included the acquisition of all planned project lines and cross flights. The cross flights were flown perpendicular to the planned flight lines and their data used in the in-situ calibration of the sensor. The mission was processed using Leica IPAS-TC software to determine both the airborne GNSS trajectory, and the blending of inertial data. Aerometric operated a GPS base station on location during the acquisition of this data. The position of the base station and raw GPS data were computed by Aerometric for use in processing.&#xD; The airborne GNSS/IMU post processed data along with the LiDAR raw measurements were processed using Leica IPAS-TC 3.1. This software was used to match the raw LiDAR measurements with the computed positions and attitudes of the LiDAR sensor. The result was a point cloud of LiDAR measured points referenced to the ground control system. One LAS 1.2 file was generated per flightline. We used 285 checkpoints acquired by UMIAQ to compute the vertical accuracy. The computed RMSE at the 95th percentile confidence interval was 0.143 meters, meeting the general LiDAR data vertical accuracy specifications.

One mission was flown. The LiDAR data for this project was collected with the Aerometric Leica ALS-70 LiDAR system. All flight planning and acquisition was completed using Leica FPES. Aerometric used the following sensor acquisition settings. The flight altitude (above ground level) was 1195-1197 meters, laser pulse rate was 230.8 kHz, mirror scan frequency was 58 Hz, scan angle (+/-) was 16o, side lap was 50 %, and ground speed was 160 kts. &#xD; The LiDAR data for this project was acquired in one mission. Airborne GPS and IMU data was collected during acquisition for use in determining the sensor's position. The mission included the acquisition of all planned project lines and cross flights. The cross flights were flown perpendicular to the planned flight lines and their data used in the in-situ calibration of the sensor. The mission was processed using Leica IPAS-TC software to determine both the airborne GNSS trajectory, and the blending of inertial data. Aerometric operated a GPS base station on location during the acquisition of this data. The position of the base station and raw GPS data were computed by Aerometric for use in processing.&#xD; The airborne GNSS/IMU post processed data along with the LiDAR raw measurements were processed using Leica IPAS-TC 3.1. This software was used to match the raw LiDAR measurements with the computed positions and attitudes of the LiDAR sensor. The result was a point cloud of LiDAR measured points referenced to the ground control system. One LAS 1.2 file was generated per flightline. We used 285 checkpoints acquired by UMIAQ to compute the vertical accuracy. The computed RMSE at the 95th percentile confidence interval was 0.145 meters, meeting the general LiDAR data vertical accuracy specifications.

This program runs on a small, single-board computer (SBC), under the Microsoft Windows XP (SP2) operating system. The data are logged into day-long files that begin and end at midnight. The computer clocks are set to UTC. The data are uploaded to a server in Lincoln, NE every night where they are archived, processed (daily to weekly), and sent to various data archives (NGEE, AmeriFlux, etc).If no data were collected, -9999 is entered in the data spaces and the appropriate QC flag is set. Raw data are stored in binary files as 4-byte (single precision) real numbers, and represent the 10 Hz outputs of the Gill R3-50 sonic anemometer, the LiCor LI-7500A open-path IRGA (CO2 and H2O), and the LiCor LI-7700 CH4 open-pathTDLS. The high frequency data are post-processed by a system called HuskerProc which we describe here. One of the parameters input to HuskerProc through its setup file is the averaging period length. 30 minutes will be used throughout this project. When HuskerFlux is started (and at every subsequent midnight), a full-day data file (for the next day) is generated and filled with zeros. As raw data (from the instruments) comes in, the zeros are over-written in the appropriate locations. Each location (or 'line' of data) represents a clock tick of 0.1 seconds. Because of this structure, if the program is started at a time other than midnight or is started and stopped, there may be gaps in the data. The first task that HuskerProc performs is to examine the data file and mark the individual averaging periods (as determined by the setup file) as either complete or incomplete. An incomplete period is defined as one in which 2% or more of the data are missing. HuskerProc then performs a 'circular covariance' calculation and determines an optimum delay time (between the vertical wind speed and the covariance 'partner') for each covariance (or flux) requested in the set up file and shifts the data appropriately, correcting for time lags between instruments. This can be overridden with an appropriate switch in the set up file to use a specified delay. Next, any voltages or other quantities read from the raw data file are converted to appropriate units according to one of several algorithms selected in the set up file. After this, HuskerProc does a quality check of the data. A moving window (of length specified in the set up file) is passed over the data, and spikes or out-of-range values (as determined by parameters in the set up file) are replaced with the mean value from the current window. The three orthogonal wind speeds are then rotated into a coordinate system where the vertical and cross wind mean velocities are zero.&#xD; The heart of HuskerProc is the statistical analysis of the time series collected by HuskerFlux. Because this usually involves the summations of large numbers of data points, several steps have been taken to assure the best precision and to minimize round-off errors. First, all statistical calculations are performed in 'double-precision arithmetic' that is, as 8-byte real numbers. Second, variances are computed using the 'corrected two-pass algorithm' as described in Numerical Recipes in Fortran (NRF). Statistical descriptors (skewness and kurtosis) are also calculated as described in NRF. Covariances are calculated in this step. To provide an estimate of the flux uncertainty, the variance of covariances are calculated (Billesbach 2011, Finkelstein and Sims 2001). Another estimate (Random Shuffle) is also calculated (Billesbach 2011).&#xD; From these covariances, fluxes are calculated using standard definitions. HuskerProc will also read an (optional) meteorology file that, if present, is used to adjust several 'constants' such as the latent heat of vaporization, specific heat of air, air density, etc. This information is also used to calculate several ancillary quantities such as saturation vapor pressure, vapor pressure deficit, etc. This information is culled from the slow response data file. If this file is not present, HuskerProc uses a set of standard default values (P=96.0 kPa, T=20.0 C, RH=40%). During this step, certain, routine corrections are applied to appropriate fluxes such as humidity corrections to sensible heat. Note that the Gill R3-50 applies the cross-wind temperature correction internally.&#xD; A set of corrections and other quantities are also calculated. These include the full set of Webb-Pearman-Leuning terms (Webb et al, 1980), frequency corrections (Moore, 1986) (which are only applied in the cumulative b1 and c1 files), spectroscopic corrections (A, B, C for the LI-7700 LiCor, 2011), friction velocity (u*), the Monin-Obuknov stability parameter (z/L), and the roughness length (zo).&#xD; In the next processing step, the eddy covariance data are combined with data from the slow response system, and a set of quality control parameters are generated. This process results in a product, which is the most highly processed product, sent to the NGEE archive. These files produced in this step contain lines for every data period in the year.&#xD; QA/QC values (where appropriate) for means, variances, and uncertainties are determined by the maximum and minimum allowed values for that quantity. For quantities (such as fluxes or corrected sonic temperature) that depend on other variables, these dependencies are also checked for validity. Fluxes are also flagged if the variances of their components are excessive. Finally fluxes are flagged if there is insufficient turbulence or wind speed. The 'other' category is used with fluxes that are derived from the LI-7700 and LI-7500A. This flag is set when the status words from these instruments indicate a problem.

When HuskerFlux is started (and at every subsequent midnight), a full-day data file (for the next day) is generated and filled with zeros. As raw data (from the instruments) comes in, the zeros are over-written in the appropriate locations. Each location (or 'line' of data) represents a clock tick of 0.1 seconds. Because of this structure, if the program is started at a time other than midnight or is started and stopped, there may be gaps in the data. The first task that HuskerProc performs is to examine the data file and mark the individual averaging periods (as determined by the setup file) as either complete or incomplete. An incomplete period is defined as one in which 2% or more of the data are missing. HuskerProc then performs a 'circular covariance' calculation and determines an optimum delay time (between the vertical wind speed and the covariance 'partner') for each covariance (or flux) requested in the set up file and shifts the data appropriately, correcting for time lags between instruments. This can be overridden with an appropriate switch in the set up file to use a specified delay. Next, any voltages or other quantities read from the raw data file are converted to appropriate units according to one of several algorithms selected in the set up file. After this, HuskerProc does a quality check of the data. A moving window (of length specified in the set up file) is passed over the data, and spikes or out-of-range values (as determined by parameters in the set up file) are replaced with the mean value from the current window. The three orthogonal wind speeds are then rotated into a coordinate system where the vertical and cross wind mean velocities are zero.&#xD; The heart of HuskerProc is the statistical analysis of the time series collected by HuskerFlux. Because this usually involves the summations of large numbers of data points, several steps have been taken to assure the best precision and to minimize round-off errors. First, all statistical calculations are performed in 'double-precision arithmetic' that is, as 8-byte real numbers. Second, variances are computed using the 'corrected two-pass algorithm' as described in Numerical Recipes in Fortran (NRF). Statistical descriptors (skewness and kurtosis) are also calculated as described in NRF. Covariances are calculated in this step. To provide an estimate of the flux uncertainty, the variance of covariances are calculated (Billesbach 2011, Finkelstein and Sims 2001). Another estimate (Random Shuffle) is also calculated (Billesbach 2011).&#xD; From these covariances, fluxes are calculated using standard definitions. HuskerProc will also read an (optional) meteorology file that, if present, is used to adjust several 'constants' such as the latent heat of vaporization, specific heat of air, air density, etc. This information is also used to calculate several ancillary quantities such as saturation vapor pressure, vapor pressure deficit, etc. This information is culled from the slow response data file. If this file is not present, HuskerProc uses a set of standard default values (P=96.0 kPa, T=20.0 C, RH=40%). During this step, certain, routine corrections are applied to appropriate fluxes such as humidity corrections to sensible heat. Note that the Gill R3-50 applies the cross-wind temperature correction internally.&#xD; A set of corrections and other quantities are also calculated. These include the full set of Webb-Pearman-Leuning terms (Webb et al, 1980), frequency corrections (Moore, 1986) (which are only applied in the cumulative b1 and c1 files), spectroscopic corrections (A, B, C for the LI-7700 LiCor, 2011), friction velocity (u*), the Monin-Obuknov stability parameter (z/L), and the roughness length (zo).&#xD; In the next processing step, the eddy covariance data are combined with data from the slow response system, and a set of quality control parameters are generated. This process results in a product, which is the most highly processed product, sent to the NGEE archive. These files produced in this step contain lines for every data period in the year.&#xD; QA/QC values (where appropriate) for means, variances, and uncertainties are determined by the maximum and minimum allowed values for that quantity. For quantities (such as fluxes or corrected sonic temperature) that depend on other variables, these dependencies are also checked for validity. Fluxes are also flagged if the variances of their components are excessive. Finally fluxes are flagged if there is insufficient turbulence or wind speed. The 'other' category is used with fluxes that are derived from the LI-7700 and LI-7500A. This flag is set when the status words from these instruments indicate a problem.

During each survey, a meter tape was secured to each transect's end-point and an elevation/thaw depth was measured every 0.5 m along the meter tape. The elevation survey was made using the digital level TopCon DL-502. The known benchmark/reference elevation was surveyed at the beginning and at the end of each survey. Note that the ground elevation, especially moss-covered, is difficult to determine within ~5 cm. A pointed 1.25 m long and 1 cm diameter metal probe was used to determine thaw depth. The ground surface elevation was surveyed with the digital level and rod, while the thaw depth and water level was measured locally with the rod (water) and probe (thaw). Each grid surveys took 1.5 to 6 h. DATA PROCESSING: All values were processed to represent absolute elevation (meter above sea level). Water surface elevation measurements were averaged within respective polygon feature. The value is only reported at locations where surface inundation was observed. The location coordinates (x and y) were presented as relative values in the field, but translated into UTM coordinates using linear interpolation from the DGPS grid corner coordinates. 20150312"

The diver in Well QA2 was damaged during June 2014 by being frozen into the thaw layer and accordingly only manual measurements are presented.&#xD; &#xD; Area B: The early-June 2013 cold event destroyed the Diver sensors in wells B70 and B71 (due to ice formation) and because of the water table being exceptionally low in these troughs, no manual measurements are available for the 2013 season. Well B67 is located in the center of a high-center ice wedge polygon. Hence the well was dry down to the frost table for most of the time during all three seasons, despite montly instrument adjustments as thaw progressed during the summer. Precipitation events, however, were observed to cause short-term accumulation of water in the well. The elevation of this water level is poorly calibrated for the 2013 season, as it was difficult to make a manual measurement of the water table at great depth during the periods of data collection, and should be considered approximate to ~ 5 cm. However, the 2014 data for the well is well calibrated due to an exceptionally high water period in late June of 2014. Instrument malfunction occurred in Well B64 during the 2014 season and accordingly only manual measurements are presented. Well QB1 was not installed until the spring of 2013; hence, no 2012 data is available at this location.&#xD; &#xD; Area C: Well CP1 was installed during the spring of 2013 and accordingly no data exists at this well for the 2012 season. Damage of an unknown nature seems to have occured to the Diver in Well C43 in July of 2014, resulting in a partially corrupted datafile, and accordingly only manual measurements are presented after July 10 of 2014 for that season. Well C39 was dry throughout July of 2012 to the depth of the Odyssey free weight and hence no data was collected during this period. The Odyssey in Well C31 produced questionable readings; the data for the 2012 season is accordingly incomplete and may contain erroneous data. Well C33 was installed in 2013 and the Diver used to measure water levels for the 2013 seasons was damaged by freezing. Accordingly, no data exists for 2012 and manual measurements are all that are available for 2013. Wells C-b, C-c, QC1, QC2, and QC3 were installed in 2013. All except for QC3 contained Divers through the 2013 season. However, the diver in C-b was damaged during this time. Well QC3 only contained a Diver during the 2014 season.

The elevation of this water level is poorly calibrated for the 2013 season, as it was difficult to make a manual measurement of the water table at great depth during the periods of data collection, and should be considered approximate to ~ 5 cm. However, the 2014 data for the well is well calibrated due to an exceptionally high water period in late June of 2014. Instrument malfunction occurred in Well B64 during the 2014 season and accordingly only manual measurements are presented. Well QB1 was not installed until the spring of 2013; hence, no 2012 data is available at this location.&#xD; &#xD; Area C: Well CP1 was installed during the spring of 2013 and accordingly no data exists at this well for the 2012 season. Damage of an unknown nature seems to have occured to the Diver in Well C43 in July of 2014, resulting in a partially corrupted datafile, and accordingly only manual measurements are presented after July 10 of 2014 for that season. Well C39 was dry throughout July of 2012 to the depth of the Odyssey free weight and hence no data was collected during this period. The Odyssey in Well C31 produced questionable readings; the data for the 2012 season is accordingly incomplete and may contain erroneous data. Well C33 was installed in 2013 and the Diver used to measure water levels for the 2013 seasons was damaged by freezing. Accordingly, no data exists for 2012 and manual measurements are all that are available for 2013. Wells C-b, C-c, QC1, QC2, and QC3 were installed in 2013. All except for QC3 contained Divers through the 2013 season. However, the diver in C-b was damaged during this time. Well QC3 only contained a Diver during the 2014 season. Accordingly, no 2012 data is presented for any of these wells, and only 2014 Diver data for C-b and QC3.&#xD; &#xD; Area D: no issues to report. field Manual measurements of water levels along with seasonally installed non-vented pressure transducers that were calibrated to manual measurements. &#xD; &#xD; Wells were installed in early May 2012 and 2013 using a SiPRE corer or a 2 in auger. The wells were made by 1 1/4 in or 2 in diameter white PVC pipe about 5 ft long with 1/4 in diameter holes drilled about 0.5 to 1 in apart in three transects along the side walls. The well was anchored about 1 ft into the permafrost by three bolts sticking out of the side of the PVC pipe about 0.5 to 1 cm. Manual water levels were measured as the distance from a mark near the top of the pipe to the water surface. The mark was made with a saw (~ 2cm long horizontal cut). Divers and Odyssey loggers were hung inside the pipe using a nylon string.&#xD; &#xD; Water level elevations are given as absolute elevation (meters above sea level) via a detailed level surveying (September of 2012, 2013, and 2014, and July of 2013) of each well to a known benchmark. The elevation survey was made using the digital level TopCon DL-502. Note that the soft ground (moss), especially in troughs, makes it difficult to determine the true elevation of the ground surface within ~2 cm. Well names are given in Table 1 and all surveyed elevations are given in Table 2. The averaged surveyed elevation for respective mark on each well was used to produce the presented continuous water level dataset.&#xD; &#xD; Water level fluctuations were determined using Odyssey conductivity loggers (2012) and Schlumberger "Diver" non-vented pressure transducers (2013 and 2014). Odysseys remained installed for the duration of the 3 seasons, while Divers were installed during June of 2013 and 2014. Divers were manually lowered on a sub-monthly basis (June and July) as the active layer thaw progressed and removed in September of 2013 and 2014. Manual measurements of water level were conducted periodically during all three seasons in order to establish a reference for calibration of the data loggers. &#xD; &#xD; Water level elevations are given as absolute elevation (meters above sea level) via a detailed level surveying (September of 2012, 2013, and 2014, and July of 2013) of each well to a known benchmark."

Each core was drilled from a different location at varying depths. A few days after drilling, the cores were stored in coolers packed with dry ice and flown to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, CA. 3-dimensional images of the cores were constructed using a medical X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner at 120kV. Hydraulic conductivity samples were extracted from these cores at LBNL Richmond Field Station in Richmond, CA, in February 2014 by cutting 5 to 8 inch segments using a chop saw. Samples were packed individually and stored at freezing temperatures to minimize any changes in structure or loss of ice content prior to analysis. &#xD; Hydraulic conductivity was determined through falling head tests using a permeameter [ELE International, Model #: K-770B] (Appendix A). Samples were placed in a latex membrane via a membrane stretcher while frozen. Use of a membrane stretcher made the membranes easier to secure and minimized contact with the sample. A clear polycarbonate sleeve, fabricated with a stainless steel ring at the bottom to keep the sleeve from floating, was placed around the sample inside the permeameter to minimize deformation during analysis. The permeameter was filled with water and 1.0 PSI of air was applied for confining pressure during sample defrost. Outflow valves were left open to allow for incremental thawing and samples were left to thaw for approximately 12 hours. &#xD; After approximately 12 hours of thaw, initial falling head tests were performed. When the flow was significantly too fast or too slow, the analysis was stopped and the burette size was adjusted accordingly (i.e. a larger diameter burette was used for flows that were faster than desired or a smaller diameter burette was used for flows that were slower than desired). Two to four measurements were collected on each sample and collection stopped when the applied head load exceeded 25% change from the original load. Analyses were performed between 2 to 3 times for each sample. The final hydraulic conductivity calculations were computed using methodology of Das et al., 1985. doi:10.5440/1170518; http://dx.doi.org/10.5440/1170518"

The original datasets are from the Barrow, AK station of NOAA/Earth System Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/brw/), and NOAA's National Climate Data Center. The latter source provides daily precipitation at the Barrow Airport (station code - GHCND:USW00027502, station name - Barrow W Post W. Rogers Airport, AK, US), because the former datasets appear large amount of data missing for precipitation. Gap-filling generally follows AmeriFlux procedure and others."

Ice--wedge polygons in the low-gradient polygonal tundra create a complex mosaic of microtopographic features. The microtopography plays a critical role in regulating the fine scale variability in thermal and hydrological regimes in the polygonal tundra landscape underlain by continuous permafrost. Modeling of thermal regimes of this sensitive ecosystem is essential for understanding the landscape behaviour under current as well as changing climate. We present here an end-to-end effort for high resolution numerical modeling of thermal hydrology at real-world field sites, utilizing the best available data to characterize and parameterize the models. We develop approaches to model the thermal hydrology of polygonal tundra and apply them at four study sites at Barrow, Alaska spanning across low to transitional to high-centered polygon and representative of broad polygonal tundra landscape. A multi--phase subsurface thermal hydrology model (PFLOTRAN) was developed and applied to study the thermal regimes at four sites. Using high resolution LiDAR DEM, microtopographic features of the landscape were characterized and represented in the high resolution model mesh. Best available soil data from field observations and literature was utilized to represent the complex heterogeneous subsurface in the numerical model. This data collection provides the complete set of input files, forcing data sets and computational meshes for simulations using PFLOTRAN for four sites at Barrow Environmental Observatory.

Active layer pore water sample depths ranged from approximately 5-57 cm from the soil surface. A subset of 24 samples active layer pore water samples in polygonal terrain and surrounding drainages yielded sufficient sample volume and NO3- concentrations (see Supporting Information) for analysis of 15N and 18O of NO3- (Table S1, Figure 1). These isotopic results are the primary focus of the study. &#xD; Two set of surface and active layer pore water samples were collected. Samples were collected from troughs and centers of high- and low-centered polygons (Figure 2), herein defined as polygonal samples. High- and flat-centered polygons are not differentiated, as both tend to have slightly elevated, more oxic centers. Additionally, in 2013, surface and active layer pore water samples were collected from the periphery of drainages (i.e. streams, ponded areas in channels, etc.) in and around the BEO (Figure 1 and Table S1), herein defined as drainage samples. Samples from drainages were typically collected from three depths at each location, including, 1) adjacent surface waters, 2) shallow subsurface pore waters (up to 15 cm depth from the surface; commonly organic-rich), and 3) at the frost table (bottom of the unfrozen active layer at the time of sampling; often mineral-rich and silty in texture; < 60 cm from the surface, Table S1). &#xD; Surface waters were collected as grab samples in 1 L bottles (HDPE, Nalgene). Subsurface active layer pore waters from polygonal terrain and drainages were collected using a combination of techniques. For saturated shallow organic-rich soils, stainless steel drive points (Solinst; 2.1 cm inner diameter) were installed and water was pumped into 1 L bottles (HDPE, Nalgene) using a hand-pump vacuum or peristaltic pump (Masterflex). Macro-rhizons [Seeberg- Elverfeldt et al., 2005] were more effective for extracting water from deeper saturated soils at the frost table. Macro-rhizon samplers were installed into soils and pore waters were extracted within 2 h into 60-mL syringes. Passive capillary fiberglass samplers (wick samplers) [Frisbee et al., 2010a; Frisbee et al., 2010b], along with macro-rhizon samplers, were used to sample pore waters from the unsaturated soil in the centers of high-centered polygons. Wicks were installed at 5 cm depth in the organic horizon and 20 cm depth in the mineral horizon. Additionally, active layer wells made from slotted PVC pipes (10 cm diameter) were installed in the BEO intensive sampling area during the summer of 2012. Multilevel samplers (MLS; Margan, Netanya, Israel) were deployed in the PVC wells. The MLS consisted of a solid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) rod, which was drilled to receive horizontally oriented 40 mL cylindrical diffusion cells every 10 cm depth. The cells were filled with deionized water and sealed with 0.2 1/4 m nylon membranes. The cells were isolated by depth in the well casing with neoprene seals at 10 cm depth intervals [Crenshaw et al., 2010]. Solute equilibration was allowed to proceed for a minimum of one month. Subsurface samples for NO3- isotopic analyses were collected by macro-rhizons, diffusion cells, or passive wicks (Table S1), which have been shown to provide representative soil pore water chemistry [Gee et al., 2003; Feaga and Selker, 2004; Seeberg-Elverfeldt et al., 2005; Frisbee et al., 2010a; Frisbee et al., 2010b; Crenshaw et al., 2010]. Quantitative recovery of solutes reduces or eliminates the potential for isotopic fractionation associated with sampling. &#xD; Surface and pore water samples were filtered (0.45 1/4 m) and stored on ice packs in the field then frozen until analyzed at the Geochemistry and Geomaterials Research Laboratory (GGRL), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) (Los Alamos, NM, USA). NO3- and NH4+ concentrations were measured where sufficient sample volume was available (see Supporting Information for analytical details). Similarly, NO3- and NH4+ isotopes (15N and 18O, and 15N, respectively) were measured for samples with sufficient sample volume and NO3- and NH4+ concentrations (see Supporting Information for analytical details). The 15N of DON was also measured on a subset of samples. Water isotopes (2H) were measured on all samples except those collected by the MLS, the cells of which are initially filled with deionized water, thereby rendering such samples unusable for water isotopic analysis. &#xD; 2.3. Snowmelt &#xD; Freshly melted, ponded snowmelt and snowmelt runoff samples were collected as daily grab samples from 11 locations for 14 consecutive days during the brief two week snowmelt period (from 30 May 2013 through 13 June 2013); with the exception of one location where samples were not collected on 7 June 2013). One additional snow sample collected in May of 2013 prior to snowmelt was also analyzed for NO3- concentrations and isotopes. A total of 153 snow samples were measured for NO3- concentrations. 11 samples with the highest NO3- concentrations (representing 7 of the 11 locations; and the additional snow sample) were measured for NO3- isotopes (Table S1). The isotopic composition of dry or wet deposition of atmospheric NO3- during the growing season has not been determined for the site.&#xD; 2.4. Permafrost and Active Layer SOM&#xD; Permafrost soil cores were excavated from a range of microtopographic features (see Polygonal-Type and Location in Table 1) in and around the BEO (cores were obtained as described by Roy Chowdhury et al. [2015] or by using a hand held SIPRE auger system) during April of 2012 and April and May of 2013. Ice NO3- concentrations and isotopes were measured on a subset of these samples. Details on core subsampling and sample preparation are provided in the Supporting Information. Water isotopes were also determined for those permafrost samples amenable to NO3- isotopic analysis. Water isotope from massive ice samples were measured by conventional isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) while water isotopes from textural ice were measured by equilibration of thawed core samples with dry air in plastic bags and subsequent analysis by cavity ring down spectroscopy [Lis et al., 2008]. &#xD; 15N of SOM was measured for 50 samples collected from soil cores taken from the active layer as part of NGEE vegetation studies performed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) researchers. &#xD; 2.5 Chemical and Isotopic Analysis&#xD; Detailed descriptions of chemical and isotopic analysis methodology for all sample types are provided in the Supporting Information. Samples were processed and analyzed after collection during 2012 and 2013."

Water isotopes (2H) were measured on all samples except those collected by the MLS, the cells of which are initially filled with deionized water, thereby rendering such samples unusable for water isotopic analysis. &#xD; 2.3. Snowmelt &#xD; Freshly melted, ponded snowmelt and snowmelt runoff samples were collected as daily grab samples from 11 locations for 14 consecutive days during the brief two week snowmelt period (from 30 May 2013 through 13 June 2013); with the exception of one location where samples were not collected on 7 June 2013). One additional snow sample collected in May of 2013 prior to snowmelt was also analyzed for NO3- concentrations and isotopes. A total of 153 snow samples were measured for NO3- concentrations. 11 samples with the highest NO3- concentrations (representing 7 of the 11 locations; and the additional snow sample) were measured for NO3- isotopes (Table S1). The isotopic composition of dry or wet deposition of atmospheric NO3- during the growing season has not been determined for the site.&#xD; 2.4. Permafrost and Active Layer SOM&#xD; Permafrost soil cores were excavated from a range of microtopographic features (see Polygonal-Type and Location in Table 1) in and around the BEO (cores were obtained as described by Roy Chowdhury et al. [2015] or by using a hand held SIPRE auger system) during April of 2012 and April and May of 2013. Ice NO3- concentrations and isotopes were measured on a subset of these samples. Details on core subsampling and sample preparation are provided in the Supporting Information. Water isotopes were also determined for those permafrost samples amenable to NO3- isotopic analysis. Water isotope from massive ice samples were measured by conventional isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) while water isotopes from textural ice were measured by equilibration of thawed core samples with dry air in plastic bags and subsequent analysis by cavity ring down spectroscopy [Lis et al., 2008]. &#xD; 15N of SOM was measured for 50 samples collected from soil cores taken from the active layer as part of NGEE vegetation studies performed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) researchers. &#xD; 2.5 Chemical and Isotopic Analysis&#xD; Detailed descriptions of chemical and isotopic analysis methodology for all sample types are provided in the Supporting Information. Samples were processed and analyzed after collection during 2012 and 2013."

Active layer pore water sample depths ranged from approximately 5-57 cm from the soil surface. A subset of 24 samples active layer pore water samples in polygonal terrain and surrounding drainages yielded sufficient sample volume and NO3- concentrations (see Supporting Information) for analysis of 15N and 18O of NO3- (Table S1, Figure 1). These isotopic results are the primary focus of the study. &#xD; Two set of surface and active layer pore water samples were collected. Samples were collected from troughs and centers of high- and low-centered polygons (Figure 2), herein defined as polygonal samples. High- and flat-centered polygons are not differentiated, as both tend to have slightly elevated, more oxic centers. Additionally, in 2013, surface and active layer pore water samples were collected from the periphery of drainages (i.e. streams, ponded areas in channels, etc.) in and around the BEO (Figure 1 and Table S1), herein defined as drainage samples. Samples from drainages were typically collected from three depths at each location, including, 1) adjacent surface waters, 2) shallow subsurface pore waters (up to 15 cm depth from the surface; commonly organic-rich), and 3) at the frost table (bottom of the unfrozen active layer at the time of sampling; often mineral-rich and silty in texture; < 60 cm from the surface, Table S1). &#xD; Surface waters were collected as grab samples in 1 L bottles (HDPE, Nalgene). Subsurface active layer pore waters from polygonal terrain and drainages were collected using a combination of techniques. For saturated shallow organic-rich soils, stainless steel drive points (Solinst; 2.1 cm inner diameter) were installed and water was pumped into 1 L bottles (HDPE, Nalgene) using a hand-pump vacuum or peristaltic pump (Masterflex). Macro-rhizons [Seeberg- Elverfeldt et al., 2005] were more effective for extracting water from deeper saturated soils at the frost table. Macro-rhizon samplers were installed into soils and pore waters were extracted within 2 h into 60-mL syringes. Passive capillary fiberglass samplers (wick samplers) [Frisbee et al., 2010a; Frisbee et al., 2010b], along with macro-rhizon samplers, were used to sample pore waters from the unsaturated soil in the centers of high-centered polygons. Wicks were installed at 5 cm depth in the organic horizon and 20 cm depth in the mineral horizon. Additionally, active layer wells made from slotted PVC pipes (10 cm diameter) were installed in the BEO intensive sampling area during the summer of 2012. Multilevel samplers (MLS; Margan, Netanya, Israel) were deployed in the PVC wells. The MLS consisted of a solid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) rod, which was drilled to receive horizontally oriented 40 mL cylindrical diffusion cells every 10 cm depth. The cells were filled with deionized water and sealed with 0.2 1/4 m nylon membranes. The cells were isolated by depth in the well casing with neoprene seals at 10 cm depth intervals [Crenshaw et al., 2010]. Solute equilibration was allowed to proceed for a minimum of one month. Subsurface samples for NO3- isotopic analyses were collected by macro-rhizons, diffusion cells, or passive wicks (Table S1), which have been shown to provide representative soil pore water chemistry [Gee et al., 2003; Feaga and Selker, 2004; Seeberg-Elverfeldt et al., 2005; Frisbee et al., 2010a; Frisbee et al., 2010b; Crenshaw et al., 2010]. Quantitative recovery of solutes reduces or eliminates the potential for isotopic fractionation associated with sampling. &#xD; Surface and pore water samples were filtered (0.45 1/4 m) and stored on ice packs in the field then frozen until analyzed at the Geochemistry and Geomaterials Research Laboratory (GGRL), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) (Los Alamos, NM, USA). NO3- and NH4+ concentrations were measured where sufficient sample volume was available (see Supporting Information for analytical details). Similarly, NO3- and NH4+ isotopes (15N and 18O, and 15N, respectively) were measured for samples with sufficient sample volume and NO3- and NH4+ concentrations (see Supporting Information for analytical details). The 15N of DON was also measured on a subset of samples. Water isotopes (2H) were measured on all samples except those collected by the MLS, the cells of which are initially filled with deionized water, thereby rendering such samples unusable for water isotopic analysis. &#xD; 2.3. Snowmelt &#xD; Freshly melted, ponded snowmelt and snowmelt runoff samples were collected as daily grab samples from 11 locations for 14 consecutive days during the brief two week snowmelt period (from 30 May 2013 through 13 June 2013); with the exception of one location where samples were not collected on 7 June 2013). One additional snow sample collected in May of 2013 prior to snowmelt was also analyzed for NO3- concentrations and isotopes. A total of 153 snow samples were measured for NO3- concentrations. 11 samples with the highest NO3- concentrations (representing 7 of the 11 locations; and the additional snow sample) were measured for NO3- isotopes (Table S1). The isotopic composition of dry or wet deposition of atmospheric NO3- during the growing season has not been determined for the site.&#xD; 2.4. Permafrost and Active Layer SOM&#xD; Permafrost soil cores were excavated from a range of microtopographic features (see Polygonal-Type and Location in Table 1) in and around the BEO (cores were obtained as described by Roy Chowdhury et al.

In 2012, Ca, Mg, K, P, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, B, S, Pb, Al, Cd, NO3-N and NH4-N availability were measured during spring, summer and winter from probes installed in the centers, edges and troughs of four polygons in each of four areas of contrasting moisture regime and polygon type (Areas A, B, C, and D of Intensive Site 1). In 2013, probes were installed in centers, edges and troughs of four polygons in each of two areas (A and B, with low-centered and high-centered polygons respectively) at two-week intervals and at 3 soil depths to capture fine-scale seasonal dynamics of NO3-N and NH4-N.&#xD; PRS probes are ion exchange resin membranes held in plastic supports that are inserted into soil to measure ion supply in situ. The anion and cation exchange with the membrane is intended to mimic plant uptake and thus provide a relevant measure of soil nutrient bioavailability. Measurements are made per area of probe membrane and cannot be converted to concentrations or related to soil volume. doi:10.5440/1120920, http://dx.doi.org/10.5440/1120920"

Data are considered complete in the context of the information presented in the abstract. Users are advised to read the rest of the metadata record carefully for additional details. field Plant community composition was determined in 48, 1 x 1 m permanent plots between 17th July and 29th July 2012. Aerial percentage cover of all vascular, bryophyte and lichen species in each plot was estimated. The canopy was assumed to have two layers (i.e. sum of vascular plant species coverage 100 percent sum of moss/lichen coverage and bare ground 100 percent). &#xD; &#xD; Vegetation heights (dominant species and whole plant community) were measured during the plant community survey. Measurements were made using a steel ruler, considering zero to be the top of the moss layer and measuring without disturbing the canopy.&#xD; &#xD; Temporary transects were installed on all polygons containing vegetation plots on 19th August 2013, and surveyed using differential GPS. Communities boundaries along the transects were recorded using a measuring tape."

To address this knowledge gap, we synthesized available literature on tundra roots, including their distribution, dynamics, and contribution to ecosystem carbon and nutrient fluxes, and we highlighted key aspects of their representation in terrestrial biosphere models. Across all tundra ecosystems, belowground plant biomass exceeded aboveground biomass, with the exception of polar desert tundra. Roots were shallowly-distributed in the thin layer of soil that thaws annually, and were often found in surface organic soil horizons. Root traits including distribution, chemistry, anatomy, and resource partitioning play an important role in controlling plant species competition, and therefore ecosystem carbon and nutrient fluxes, under changing climatic conditions, but have only been quantified for a small fraction of tundra plants. Further, the annual production and mortality of fine roots are key components of ecosystem processes in tundra, but extant data are sparse. Tundra root traits and dynamics should be the focus of future research efforts. Better representation of the dynamics and characteristics of tundra roots will improve the utility of models for evaluating the responses of tundra ecosystems to changing environmental conditions. http://dx.doi.org/10.5440/1114222; DOI: 10.5440/1114222."

Our primary goals were to highlight current knowledge of roots and their role in key ecosystem processes in arctic tundra, and to identify priority areas for future research. Additionally, we compared current experimental and observational knowledge with the representation of tundra roots in models used to simulate C and nutrient cycling in the Arctic.&#xD; We systematically identified and compiled data on root traits and root-soil interactions in arctic tundra. We defined arctic tundra according to Walker et al. (2005): low-growing vegetation north of the Arctic treeline. Because data on roots in arctic tundra are scarce, we also included data from sites with similar plant species or plant communities (e.g., subarctic tundra in Abisko, Sweden and subalpine tundra in Eagle Creek, Alaska). Data were compiled from various sources, including primary literature, books, and theses.&#xD; Our main focus in this literature review was on fine plant roots, which are an important component of ecosystem C and nutrient budgets because of their high respiration rates, high nutrient content, short lifespan relative to larger-diameter woody roots, and their role in stimulating microbial activity through the release of water and soluble exudates. Fine roots have generally been defined as less than 2 mm in diameter (Pregitzer, 2002), and we used that definition here because it was most appropriate to the available literature. Recently, the definition of fine roots has evolved to a more functional characterization, where fine roots are short-lived, non-woody roots whose main function is the uptake of nutrients and water from the soil (Guo et al., 2008). This functional definition is more relevant for understanding root processes and their representation in large-scale models, and we discuss how a next generation of measurements might improve our functional understanding of roots in tundra ecosystems.&#xD; &#xD; References:&#xD; Guo DL, Li H, Mitchell RJ, Han WX, Hendricks JJ, Fahey TJ, Hendrick RL. 2008.

Our primary goals were to highlight current knowledge of roots and their role in key ecosystem processes in arctic tundra, and to identify priority areas for future research. Within each of several focused sections, ranging from the distribution and dynamics of tundra roots to the contribution of roots to ecosystem C and nutrient cycling, we touched on four key themes: (1) how tundra root traits and processes may differ from those observed in other biomes, (2) the relationships between belowground and aboveground tundra plant traits, (3) the response of roots to changing edaphic and environmental conditions, and (4) priorities for future research on fine roots in tundra ecosystems. Additionally, we compared current experimental and observational knowledge with the representation of tundra roots in models used to simulate C and nutrient cycling in the Arctic. Our goal was to determine to what extent different model conceptualizations and parameterizations are needed to accurately represent the range of root traits and processes of species found in arctic tundra ecosystems.&#xD; &#xD; We systematically identified and compiled data on root traits and root-soil interactions in arctic tundra. We defined arctic tundra as low-growing vegetation north of the Arctic treeline, encompassing five bioclimatic subzones ranging from the cold and barren subzone A to the warmer and more vegetated subzone E. Because data on roots in arctic tundra are scarce, we also included data from sites with similar plant species or plant communities (e.g., subarctic tundra in Abisko, Sweden, and subalpine tundra in Eagle Creek, Alaska). Data were compiled from various sources, including primary literature, books, and theses."

Fine roots have generally been defined as less than 2 mm in diameter (Pregitzer, 2002), and we used that definition here because it was most appropriate to the available literature. Recently, the definition of fine roots has evolved to a more functional characterization, where fine roots are short-lived, non-woody roots whose main function is the uptake of nutrients and water from the soil (Guo et al., 2008). This functional definition is more relevant for understanding root processes and their representation in large-scale models, and we discuss how a next generation of measurements might improve our functional understanding of roots in tundra ecosystems.&#xD; &#xD; References:&#xD; Guo DL, Li H, Mitchell RJ, Han WX, Hendricks JJ, Fahey TJ, Hendrick RL. 2008.

This functional definition is more relevant for understanding root processes and their representation in large-scale models, and we discuss how a next generation of measurements might improve our functional understanding of roots in tundra ecosystems.&#xD; &#xD; References:&#xD; Guo DL, Li H, Mitchell RJ, Han WX, Hendricks JJ, Fahey TJ, Hendrick RL. 2008.

Journal of Vegetation Science, 16: 267-282. doi: 10.1111/j.1654-1103.2005.tb02365.x We systematically identified and compiled data on root traits and root-soil interactions in arctic tundra. We defined arctic tundra according to Walker et al. (2005): low-growing vegetation north of the Arctic treeline. Because data on roots in arctic tundra are scarce, we also included data from sites with similar plant species or plant communities (e.g., subarctic tundra in Abisko, Sweden and subalpine tundra in Eagle Creek, Alaska). Data were compiled from various sources, including primary literature, books, and theses."

Landscape Ecology, 28(8):1567-1586. doi:10.1007/s10980-013-9902-0&#xD; &#xD; Abstract:&#xD; Resource and logistical constraints limit the frequency and extent of environmental observations, particularly in the Arctic, necessitating the development of a systematic sampling strategy to maximize coverage and objectively represent environmental variability at desired scales. A quantitative methodology for stratifying sampling domains, informing site selection, and determining the representativeness of measurement sites and networks is described here. Multivariate spatiotemporal clustering was applied to down-scaled general circulation model results and data for the State of Alaska at 4 km2 resolution to define multiple sets of ecoregions across two decadal time periods. Maps of ecoregions for the present (2000-2009) and future (2090-2099) were produced, showing how combinations of 37 characteristics are distributed and how they may shift in the future. Representative sampling locations are identified on present and future ecoregion maps. A representativeness metric was developed, and representativeness maps for eight candidate sampling locations were produced. This metric was used to characterize the environmental similarity of each site. This analysis provides model-inspired insights into optimal sampling strategies, offers a framework for up-scaling measurements, and provides a down-scaling approach for integration of models and measurements. These techniques can be applied at different spatial and temporal scales to meet the needs of individual measurement campaigns. doi.org/10.5440/1108686"

NGEE,CSDGM,ftp___ngee.ornl.gov_data_outgoing_metadata_Representativeness_based_Sampling_Network_Design_for_the_State_of_Alaska.xml,Purpose,/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose,"Resource and logistical constraints limit the frequency and extent of environmental observations, particularly in the Arctic, necessitating the development of a systematic sampling strategy to maximize coverage and objectively represent environmental variability at desired scales. A quantitative methodology for stratifying sampling domains, informing site selection, and determining the representativeness of measurement sites and networks is described here. Multivariate spatiotemporal clustering was applied to down-scaled general circulation model results and data for the State of Alaska at 4 km2 resolution to define multiple sets of ecoregions across two decadal time periods. Maps of ecoregions for the present (2000-2009) and future (2090-2099) were produced, showing how combinations of 37 characteristics are distributed and how they may shift in the future. Representative sampling locations are identified on present and future ecoregion maps. A representativeness metric was developed, and representativeness maps for eight candidate sampling locations were produced. This metric was used to characterize the environmental similarity of each site. This analysis provides model-inspired insights into optimal sampling strategies, offers a framework for up-scaling measurements, and provides a down-scaling approach for integration of models and measurements. These techniques can be applied at different spatial and temporal scales to meet the needs of individual measurement campaigns."

Soil cores were extruded from their PVC liners and placed on sterilized photo papers upon frozen blue ice packs to limit thawing. A sterilized stainless steel spatula was used to scrape the partially thawed outer surface (1 - 2 mm) of a core, removing any sloughed material or soil displaced during drilling (Kieft, 2007). Soil horizons were visually diagnosed based on moist soil Munsell color, presence of undecomposed (Oa) or intermediately decomposed (Oe) plant-derived organic matter and presence or absence of permafrost affected soil or ice wedge segregations (Table 1). Soil cores were then divided by horizons and subsequent homogenization and subsampling was carried out one horizon at a time. The remaining soil horizons were kept intact and frozen at -20 deg C. Each soil horizon was divided into 5 to 10 cm thick sections, placed in a sterilized plastic container, and homogenized at constant room temperature under anoxic conditions allowing for minimal thawing. An oscillating power tool with sterilized cutting blades was used for all sediment processing and homogenization and containers were kept on blue icepacks. Homogenized subsamples were used for soil physico-chemical property determination and microcosm set-up.

Chambers were tall enough to enclose vegetation and were vented according to Xu et al., (2006) to minimize pressure excursions due to the Venturi effect. In inundated plots, a floating chamber was used whose base extended 4 cm below the water surface. In all other plots, chambers were seated on PVC bases extending ~15 cm below the soil surface. To minimize disturbance, bases were installed at the beginning of the sampling season and left in place throughout the remainder of the season season. For each flux measurement, the chamber was seated in a 3 cm-deep, water-filled trench in the base's top rim to create an airtight seal. A Los Gatos Research, Inc. (LGR) portable Greenhouse Gas Analyzer was used to record CO2 and CH4 concentrations within the chamber over 4-8 minutes, and the flux rate of each gas was calculated from the slope of the linear portion of the concentration vs. time curve. &#xD; Volumetric water content was measured with a MiniTrase TDR (Soilmoisture Equipment Corp). Soil temperature was measured with a thermistor or thermocouple probe, as indicated. As vegetation and inundation status varied between plots, depths of moisture and temperature measurements were determined from the top of the moss layer, bare soil, or water surface.&#xD; Soil pore gas for trace gas stable isotope and concentration analyses was collected through 0.25 in diameter stainless steel probes into 60 mL syringes using a peristaltic pump. Water samples were filtered in the field through 0.1 um syringe filters and injected directly into evacuated glass vials sealed with 14 mm-thick chlorobutyl septa (Bellco Glass, Inc). Gas samples were injected directly into vials. In cases where syringes contained a mixture of water and gas, both sample types were collected and analyzed separately&#xD; All isotope and concentration analyses were conducted at the Center for Isotope Geochemistry (CIG) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA. We report isotope ratios using the conventional delta notation. Carbon isotope ratios are reported relative to Vienna Peedee Belemnite (VPDB), and hydrogen isotope ratios are reported relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW).&#xD; We measured carbon isotope ratios of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in water samples and CO2 in gas samples using a variation on the technique outlined in Torn et al. (2003). The carbon isotope ratios of DIC or CO2 are accurate to +/- 0.33 permil (1sd) based upon repeated analyses of the laboratory standards.&#xD; Carbon isotope ratios of CH4 were measured using a Trace Gas Ultra system interfaced to a Delta V Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). CH4 was chromatographically separated from other gases in the Trace Gas Ultra using an HP-molesieve fused silica capillary column (30 m x 0.320 mm). The CH4 was then combusted to CO2 at 1000C in a capillary ceramic tube loaded with Ni, Cu, and Pt wires, dried and transferred to the IRMS for the carbon isotope measurements. The reproducibility of measured carbon isotope ratios of CH4 is estimated to be +/- 0.16 permil (1sd) based on repeated analyses of an in-house laboratory standard&#xD; Concentrations of CH4, CO2, and N2O in gas samples were determined using a 2014 Shimadzu GC. 4.5 mL of gas headspace from sample vials were flushed through a 1 mL stainless steel loop. The gases were then isolated on a HayeSep-D packed column (4 m x 1/8 in), then quantified with a flame ionization detector. For water samples, we used Henry's law with measured headspace pressures and water volumes to convert headspace CH4 and N2O concentrations to dissolved gas concentrations. DIC concentrations were calculated from IRMS results, using known sample aliquot volumes and calibrated mass 44 (CO2) peak areas.

Chambers were tall enough to enclose vegetation and were vented according to Xu et al., (2006) to minimize pressure excursions due to the Venturi effect. In inundated plots, a floating chamber was used whose base extended 4 cm below the water surface. In all other plots, chambers were seated on PVC bases extending ~15 cm below the soil surface. To minimize disturbance, bases were installed at the beginning of the sampling season and left in place throughout the remainder of the season season. For each flux measurement, the chamber was seated in a 3 cm-deep, water-filled trench in the base's top rim to create an airtight seal. A Los Gatos Research, Inc. (LGR) portable Greenhouse Gas Analyzer was used to record CO2 and CH4 concentrations within the chamber over 4-8 minutes, and the flux rate of each gas was calculated from the slope of the linear portion of the concentration vs. time curve. &#xD; Volumetric water content was measured with a MiniTrase TDR (Soilmoisture Equipment Corp). Soil temperature was measured with a thermistor or thermocouple probe, as indicated. As vegetation and inundation status varied between plots, depths of moisture and temperature measurements were determined from the top of the moss layer, bare soil, or water surface.&#xD; Soil pore gas for trace gas stable isotope and concentration analyses was collected through 0.25 in diameter stainless steel probes into 60 mL syringes using a peristaltic pump. Water samples were filtered in the field through 0.1 um syringe filters and injected directly into evacuated glass vials sealed with 14 mm-thick chlorobutyl septa (Bellco Glass, Inc). Gas samples were injected directly into vials. In cases where syringes contained a mixture of water and gas, both sample types were collected and analyzed separately&#xD; All isotope and concentration analyses were conducted at the Center for Isotope Geochemistry (CIG) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA. We report isotope ratios using the conventional delta notation. Carbon isotope ratios are reported relative to Vienna Peedee Belemnite (VPDB), and hydrogen isotope ratios are reported relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW).&#xD; We measured carbon isotope ratios of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in water samples and CO2 in gas samples using a variation on the technique outlined in Torn et al. (2003). The carbon isotope ratios of DIC or CO2 are accurate to +/- 0.33 permil (1sd) based upon repeated analyses of the laboratory standards.&#xD; Carbon isotope ratios of CH4 were measured using a Trace Gas Ultra system interfaced to a Delta V Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). CH4 was chromatographically separated from other gases in the Trace Gas Ultra using an HP-molesieve fused silica capillary column (30 m x 0.320 mm). The CH4 was then combusted to CO2 at 1000C in a capillary ceramic tube loaded with Ni, Cu, and Pt wires, dried and transferred to the IRMS for the carbon isotope measurements. The reproducibility of measured carbon isotope ratios of CH4 is estimated to be +/- 0.16 permil (1sd) based on repeated analyses of an in-house laboratory standard&#xD; Concentrations of CH4, CO2, and N2O in gas samples were determined using a 2014 Shimadzu GC. 4.5 mL of gas headspace from sample vials were flushed through a 1 mL stainless steel loop. The gases were then isolated on a HayeSep-D packed column (4 m x 1/8 in), then quantified with a flame ionization detector. For water samples, we used Henry's law with measured headspace pressures and water volumes to convert headspace CH4 and N2O concentrations to dissolved gas concentrations. DIC concentrations were calculated from IRMS results, using known sample aliquot volumes and calibrated mass 44 (CO2) peak areas.

Data include soil water content and soil water potential measured using the simple evaporation method for hydrological and biogeochemical simulations and experimental data analysis. &#xD; &#xD; Data can be used to generate a soil moisture characteristic curve, which can be fit to a variety of hydrological functions to infer critical parameters for soil physics. Considering the measured the soil water properties, the van Genuchten model predicted well the HCP, in contrast, the Kosugi model well fitted LCP which had more saturated condition."

This is done in an automated fashion using internal tools as well as through manual observation on the 2-week to monthly time scale. Radiation data is also compared with data from the ARM facility. Summer precipitation is also compared with data from the NOAA CRN facility. Data is retrieved hourly over local Barrow radio network Data is passed to data processing server Automated QA/QC is applied to the new data (internal tool following industry guidelines). Site intercomparison checks Manual observation of data for anomalies that passed the automated qc system."
