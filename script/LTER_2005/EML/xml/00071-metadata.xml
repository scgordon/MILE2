The hydrology has been monitored since 1963. Surveys were initiated in 1965, repeated in 1977, and repeated at 5 year intervals after that.  These data were collected in the summer of 1997. The stream water chemistry has been monitored since 1963. The watershed is forested by typical northern hardwood species (sugar maple, beech and yellow birch) on the lower 90% of its area and by a montane boreal transition forest of red spruce, balsam fir and white birch on the highest 10%. Surveying techniques were used in 1965 to install a grid system of 208 grid cells, each 25 x 25 m square. These grid units serve as the plot system. See the following links for more information: http://www.hubbardbrook.org/watersheds/maps/w6_zones.htm and http://www.hubbardbrook.org/watersheds/w6_grid_elevations.htm.</literalLayout></para></section><section><title>SAMPLING DESIGN</title><para><literalLayout>The inventory consists of a total inventory of all trees &gt;=10 cm dbh on the whole of the watershed (13.23 ha), as measured in each of the 208 25 m x 25 m plots. Trees &gt;=2 to &lt;=10 cm dbh were subsampled using a 3 meter wide strip along one edge of each 25 m x 25 m plot (see plot layout). The lengths of these strips are not always exactly 25 meters, due to drift or imprecise replacement of the corner stakes. The actual measured length of the strip is used to calculate the area of the plot (as given in the data) for the smaller trees. For the larger trees, plot area was not adjusted for drift and is assumed to be 625 sq. meters. See http://hubbardbrook.org/w6_tour/biomass-stop/sampling.htm for more information.</literalLayout></para></section><section><title>DATA DESCRIPTION</title><para><literalLayout>The data consist of the diameters (dbh) of all trees &gt;=10 cm dbh, live and dead, in the whole of the watershed (8451 individual stems). Dead trees were recorded as standing dead trees (trees dead but retaining most of their fine branches) and as snags (trees broken off above dbh or with only their major large branches still intact). Live trees were noted "sick" if they had very sparse foliage or yellowing foliage in the mid summer sampling.
A subsample of  trees &gt;=2 cm dbh and &lt;=10cm dbh were measured at the same time (2970 individual stems).
All stems that met the size criteria were measured individually, and in some years it was noted whether a stem was part of a group of stems from the same tree (i.e. multiple stems that split from a single trunk below breast height). For W6, whether or not a stem was part of a group was not recorded until 2002.</literalLayout></para></section><section><title>NOTES</title><para><literalLayout>It is not possible to compare these data between sampling years on a plot by plot basis, since trees are not individually tagged and plot corners have shifted slightly over time.  At the time of  the 1977 and 1982 inventories, many of the aluminum rods marking plot corners had come out and were replaced but not resurveyed. Also trees on the lines between plots can "drift" between plots between years depending on the observers line of sight or decision as to whether the center of the base of a tree is in one plot or the adjoining plot. In 1989 we prepared maps of each plot on which we outlined edge trees and assigned them to one plot or another. These maps have been copied on the backs of the field data collection sheets in the more recent years such that problem trees can be assigned consistently.
For extensive notes about the details of these surveys and subsequent calculations, see the notes indicated at the bottom of the interactive calculation programs.</literalLayout></para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>CALCULATIONS</title><para><literalLayout>Aboveground and belowground biomass was estimated for each stem in the inventory and is included in the data. Estimates were based on species-specific allometric equations developed at Hubbard Brook. See "How do we quantify a forest?" for details. 
Phytosociology or biomass summaries can be obtained by using our interactive calculators. Phytosociology summaries include basal area, density and frequency of each species for the watershed as a whole or for smaller units as chosen by the user. Diameter distributions for a specific species can also be selected. Biomass summaries include biomass estimates by plant part for each species for the watershed as a whole or for smaller units as chosen by the user. Options to estimate productivity and total nutrient pools in the vegetation are also available.  For extensive details about how these calculations are made, see the notes indicated at the bottom of the calculator pages.</literalLayout></para></section></description><citation scope="document"><title>The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study: forest nutrient cycling and element behavior</title><creator id="whittaker" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>R.H.</givenName><surName>Whittaker</surName></individualName></creator><creator id="likens" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>G.E.</givenName><surName>Likens</surName></individualName></creator><creator id="bormann" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>F.H.</givenName><surName>Bormann</surName></individualName></creator><creator id="eaton" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>J.S.</givenName><surName>Eaton</surName></individualName></creator><creator id="siccama" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>T.G.</givenName><surName>Siccama</surName></individualName></creator><pubDate>1979</pubDate><language>english</language><article><journal>Ecology</journal><volume>60</volume><issue>1</issue><pageRange>203-220</pageRange></article></citation><citation scope="document"><title>The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study: forest biomass and production</title><creator scope="document"><references>whittaker</references></creator><creator scope="document"><references>bormann</references></creator><creator scope="document"><references>likens</references></creator><creator scope="document"><references>siccama</references></creator><pubDate>1974</pubDate><article><journal>Ecol.
