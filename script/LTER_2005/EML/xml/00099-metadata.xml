Hydrology has been monitored since 1963, and stream water chemistry has been monitored since 1963. The watershed is forested by typical northern hardwood species (sugar maple, beech and yellow birch) on the lower 90 % of its area and by a montane boreal transition forest of red spruce, balsam fir and white birch on the highest 10%. Surveying techniques were used in 1965 to install a grid system of 208 grid cells, each 25 x 25 m square. These grid units serve as the coordinate system for sample plot selection. For more spatial information please visit the following links: http://www.hubbardbrook.org/watersheds/maps/w6_zones.htm and http://www.hubbardbrook.org/watersheds/w6_grid_elevations.htm.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Sampling was initiated in 1969-1970, repeated in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1982 and at 5 year intervals after that. These data were collected in the summer of 1977. Repeated sampling at 5 year intervals is anticipated to continue.</literalLayout></para></section><section><title>SAMPLING DESIGN</title><para><literalLayout>Each row of the Watershed 6 grid system of 25 x 25 m cells was considered a stratified sampling set and one or more cells was randomly chosen from these lines as cells to be sampled. Some rows are short, with only 1 to 4 cells, and others are longer, up to 10 cells across. The longer rows may have 2 or 3 cells sampled. The short rows may not have any cells sampled. The location of the sampling plot within each cell was selected by an x-y random number system and the location determined by pacing in to the selected coordinates from the corner of the 25 x 25 m cell. 58 of the 208 cells were sampled in 1977.</literalLayout></para></section><section><title>FIELD COLLECTION PROCEDURES</title><para><literalLayout>Once a sampling point was located by pacing, a 15 x 15 cm wooden template was placed on the forest floor and 4 nails were placed through pre-drilled holes, one on each corner. This served to hold the template in place on the forest floor and retain the forest floor material within the sample area beneath the template. A keyhole saw, clippers and a trowel were used to make a clean cut around the template, thus isolating a block of forest floor. The surrounding forest floor material was scraped back from the block leaving it as a pedestal. This block was then undercut in the mineral soil with a saw or trowel to sever any roots. Using a trowel slid beneath the block and our hands on top, the block was carefully picked up and turned over such as to rest on the wooden template. Any remaining mineral soil was carefully scraped away "up" to the bottom of the Oa layer of the forest floor. After all such mineral soil was removed, the thickness of the block was measured at the highest and lowest point on each of the 4 sides (8 measurements). The block was then placed in total in a plastic bag for return to the laboratory. (Note that in some years the forest floor was divided into sub layers --Oi, Oe, Oa or combinations of these. In 1977 the whole of the forest floor was collected undivided).</literalLayout></para></section><section><title>NOTES</title><para><literalLayout>The primary objectives of the forest floor samplings in 1976-1978 were 1) the determination of the amount of lead(Pb) in the forest floor, 2) monitoring the total mass of the forest floor over time and 3) development of a field collection methodology which was efficient and easily implemented. It was determined that separation of the forest floor at least into Oie and Oa, would have been better than no separation whatsoever, so this procedure was implemented from 1987 onwards. It was also determined that air drying the Oa would have been preferable to oven drying. Air drying makes possible the determination of exchangeable nutrients, whereas oven drying alters the cation exchange complex. Air drying of the Oa was implemented from 1992 onwards.</literalLayout></para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>LABORATORY PROCEDURES</title><para><literalLayout>The forest floor mass was oven dried at 80 oC to a constant weight, then sieved through a 2 mm screen. Sticks (fresh solid woody debris) and roots (live) larger than 2-3 mm in diameter were removed and weighed separately. Material remaining on the sieve (usually bits of bark, solid seeds, bits of hard soil, wood bits and small stones) was then divided into "sinkers" and "floaters" by testing it in water. These components ("sinkers" and "floaters") were separated and again dried and weighed. The objective was to separate the stones from the wood and roots (organic matter) left on the screen. Material passing through the screen was weighed to determine the total weight of the sample, then ground in a Wiley mill to pass a 2 mm screen. Samples of the ground forest floor were put in 4 oz. glass jars for long term preservation in the Hubbard Brook archives.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>For determination of organic content and chemical analysis, a 2.0 g sample of the oven dry ground material was placed in a pre-weighed crucible and ashed overnight at 450 oC. The ashed material was cooled and weighed. The ash was eluted with 10 ml of 6N HNO3 and heated for a few minutes (to a simmer) on a hot plate. The hot extract solution was poured into a filter paper in a funnel and into a 50 ml volumetric flask. The crucible and the material on the filter paper were rinsed several times with distilled deionized water. Following these several rinsing, the volume in the flask was brought up to 50 ml with the distilled deionized water. The 50 ml of extract solution was then placed in 120 ml plastic bottles for storage until chemical analysis. The elements Zn, Pb and Cu were determined for each sample using an AA spectrophotometer.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>In 1995, a 0.5 g sample of oven dry ground material from each jar was ashed and eluted by the method described above. The elements Ca and Mg were determined for each sample using an ICP spectrometer. Carbon and nitrogen were determined using oven dried ground material on a CHN analyzer- C and N data are not yet available. These elements are being analyzed by Steve Hamburg at Brown University.</literalLayout></para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>CALCULATIONS</title><para><literalLayout>Concentrations of elements in the forest floor were calculated on an oven dry weight basis.
