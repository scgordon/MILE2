         <abstract>This data set maps and describes the geology of the Devore 7.5' quadrangle, SanBernardino County, California. Created using Environmental Systems Research Institute'sARC/INFO software, the data base consists of the following items: (1) a map coveragecontaining geologic contacts and units, (2) attribute tables for geologic units(polygons), contacts (arcs), and site-specific data (points).  In addition, the dataset includes the following graphic and text products: (1) A PostScript graphicplot-file containing the geologic map, topography, cultural data, a Correlation of MapUnits (CMU) diagram, a Description of Map Units (DMU), an index map, a regionalgeologic and structure map, and a key for point and line symbols; (2) PDF files of thisReadme (including the metadata file as an appendix), Description of Map Units (DMU),and the graphic produced by the PostScript plot file.
The Devore quadrangle straddles part of the boundary between two major physiographicprovinces of California, the Transverse Ranges Province to the north and the PeninsularRanges Province to the south.  The north half of the quadrangle includes the eastern SanGabriel Mountains and a small part of the western San Bernardino Mountains, both withinthe east-central part of the Transverse Ranges Province.  South of the Cucamonga and SanAndreas Fault zones, the extensive alluviated area in the south half of the quadranglelies within the upper Santa Ana River Valley, and represents the northernmost part ofthe Peninsular Ranges Province.
There are numerous active faults within the quadrangle, including right-lateralstrike-slip faults of the San Andreas Fault system, which dominate the youngerstructural elements, and separate the San Gabriel from the San Bernardino Mountains.The active San Jacinto Fault zone projects toward the quadrangle from the southeast, butits location is poorly constrained not only within the quadrangle, but for at leastseveral kilometers to the southeast.  As a result, the interrelation between it, theGlen Helen Fault, and the probable easternmost part of the San Gabriel Fault isintrepretive.  Thrust faults of the Cucamonga Fault zone along the south margin of theSan Gabriel Mountains, represent the rejuvinated eastern end of a major old fault zonethat bounds the south side of the western and central Transverse Ranges (Morton andMatti, 1993).  Rejuvenation of this old fault zone, including the Cucamonga Fault zone,is apparently in response to compression in the eastern San Gabriel Mountains resultingfrom initiation of right-lateral slip on the San Jacinto Fault zone in the PeninsularRanges.The structural grain within the San Gabriel Mountains, as defined by basementrocks, is generally east striking.  Within the Devore quadrangle, these basement rocksinclude a Paleozoic (?) schist, quartzite, and marble metasedimentary sequence, whichoccurs as discontinuous lenses and septa within Cretaceous granitic rocks.  Most of thegranitic rocks are of tonalitic composition, and much of them are mylonitic.  South ofthe granitic rocks is a complex assemblage of Proterozoic (?) metamorphic rocks, atleast part of which is metasedimentary.  The assemblage was metamorphosed to upperamphibolite and lower granulite grade, and subsequently remetamorphosed to a lowermetamorphic grade.  It is also intensely deformed by mylonitization which ischaracterized by an east striking, north dipping foliation, and by a pronouncedlineation that plunges shallowly east and west.
East of Lytle Creek and west of the San Andreas Fault zone, the predominant basementlithology is Mesozoic Pelona Schist, which consists mostly of greenschist grademetabasalt and metagraywacke.  Intruding the Pelona Schist, between Lytle Creek andCajon Canyon, is the granodiorite of Telegraph Peak of Oligocene age (May and Walker,1989).  East of the San Andreas Fault in the San Bernardino Mountains, basement rocksconsist of amphibolite grade gneiss and schist intermixed with concordant anddiscordant tonalitic rock and pegmatite.  Tertiary conglomerate and sandstone occur inthe Cucamonga Fault zone and in a zone 200 to 700 m wide between strands of the SanAndreas Fault zone and localized thrust faults northeast of the San Andreas.  Most ofthe conglomerate and sandstone within the Cucamonga Fault zone is overturned formingthe north limb of an overturned syncline.  Clasts in the conglomerate are not derivedfrom any of the basement rocks in the eastern San Gabriel Mountains.  Clasts in theconglomerate and sandstone northeast of the San Andreas Fault zone do not appear to belocally derived either.  The south half of the quadrangle is dominated by the largesymmetrical alluvial-fan emanating from the canyon of Lytle Creek, and by the complexbraided stream sediments of Lytle Creek and Cajon Wash.
The San Andreas Fault is restricted to a relatively narrow zone marked by a pronouncedscarp that is especially well exposed near the east margin of the quadrangle.  Twopoorly exposed, closely spaced, north-dipping thrust faults northeast of the SanAndreas Fault have dips that appear to range from 55&#x83; to near horizontal.  Theshallower dips probably are the result of rotation of initially steeper fault surfacesby downhill surface creep.  Between the San Andreas and Glen Helen Fault zones, thereare several faults that have north facing scarps, the largest of which are the eaststriking Peters Fault and the northwest striking Tokay Hill Fault.  The Tokay HillFault is at least in part a reverse fault.  Scarps along both faults are youthfulappearing.
The Glen Helen Fault zone along the west side of Cajon Creek, is well defined by apronounced scarp from the area north of Interstate 15, south through Glen HelenRegional Park; an elongate sag pond is located within the park.
The large fault zone along Meyers Canyon, between Penstock and Lower Lytle Ridges, isprobably the eastward extension of the San Gabriel Fault zone that is deformed into anorthwest orientation due to compression in the eastern San Gabriel Mountains (Mortonand Matti, 1993).  At the south end of Sycamore Flat, this fault zone consists ofthree discreet faults distributed over a width of 300 m.  About 2.5 km northwest ofSycamore Flats, it consists of a 300 m wide shear zone.  At the north end of PenstockRidge, the fault zone has bifurcated into four strands, which at the northwest cornerof the quadrangle are distributed over a width of about one kilometer.  From thenorthern part of Sycamore Flat, for a distance of nearly 5 km northwestward, anortheast dipping reverse fault is located along the east side of the probable SanGabriel Fault zone.  This youthful reverse fault has locally placed the Oligocenegranodiorite of Telegraph Peak over detritus derived from the granodiorite.
The Lytle Creek Fault, which is commonly considered the western splay of the SanJacinto Fault zone, is located on the west side of Lytle Creek.  Lateral displacementon the Lytle Creek Fault has offset parts of the old Lytle Creek channel; this offsetgravel-filled channel is best seen at Texas Hill, near the mouth of Lytle Creek, wherethe gravel was hydraulic mined for gold in the 1890s.
The Cucamonga Fault zone consists of a one kilometer wide zone of northward dip-ping thrust faults.  Most splays of this fault zone dip north 25&#x83; to 35&#x83;.
The geologic map database contains original U.S. Geological Survey data generated bydetailed field observation and by interpretation of aerial photographs.  This digitalOpen-File map supercedes an older analog Open-File map of the quadrangle, and includesextensive new data on the Quaternary deposits, and revises some fault and bedrockdistribution within the San Gabriel Mountains.  The digital map was compiled on abase-stable cronoflex copy of the Devore 7.5í topographic base and then scribed.  Thisscribe guide was used to make a 0.007 mil blackline clear-film, from which lines andpoint were hand digitized.  Lines, points, and polygons were subsequently edited at theUSGS using standard ARC/INFO commands.  Digitizing and editing artifacts significantenough to display at a scale of 1:24,000 were corrected.  Within the database, geologiccontacts are represented as lines (arcs), geologic units as polygons, and site-specificdata as points.  Polygon, arc, and point attribute tables (.pat, .aat, and .pat,respectively) uniquely identify each geologic datum.</abstract>
         <purpose>The data set for the Devore 7.5' quadrangle was prepared under the U.S. GeologicalSurvey Southern California Areal Mapping Project (SCAMP) as part of an ongoing effort todevelop a regional geologic framework of southern California, and to utilize aGeographical Information System (GIS) format to create regional digital geologicdatabases.  These regional databases are being developed as contributions to theNational Geologic Map Database of the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program ofthe USGS.
The digital geologic map database for the Devore 7.5' quadrangle has been created as ageneral-purpose data set that is applicable to other land-related investigations in theearth and biological sciences. For example, it can be used for groundwater studies inthe San Bernardino basin, and for mineral resource evaluation studies, animal and planthabitat studies, and soil studies in the San Bernardino National Forest.  The databaseis not suitable for site-specific geologic evaluations.</purpose>

      <useconst>The Devore 7.5' geologic-map database should be used to evaluate and understand thegeologic character of the Devore 7.5' quadrangle as a whole.  The data should not beused for purposes of site-specific land-use planning or site-specific geologicevaluations.  The database is sufficiently detailed to identify and characterizegeologic materials and structures.  However, it is not sufficiently detailed forsite-specific determinations.
Use of this digital geologic map database should not violate the spatial resolution ofthe data.  Although the digital form of the data removes the constraint imposed by thescale of a paper map, the detail and accuracy inherent in map scale are also present inthe digital data.  The fact that this database was compiled and edited at a scale of1:24,000 means that higher resolution information may not have been uniformly retainedin the dataset.  Plotting at scales larger than 1:24,000 will not yield greater realdetail, although it may reveal fine-scale irregularities below the intended resolutionof the database.  Similarly, although higher resolution data is incorporated in parts ofthe map, the resolution of the combined output will be limited by the lower resolutiondata.</useconst>

      <datacred>Technical review by F.K. Miller led to significant improvements that eventually were reflected inaspects of the database, the plot file, and in the description of the geologic units of theDevore 7.5' quadrangle. Digital review by R.W. Graymer has allowed us to prepare a much improvedproduct.
Geologic mapping and digital preparation of this report were sponsored jointly by (1)the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program of the U.S. Geological Survey, (2) theCalifornia Division of Mines and Geology, and (3) the Southern California Areal MappingProject (SCAMP).  In our digital preparation of the data set, carried out in the SCAMPGeographic Information System laboratory at the University of California, Riverside byGregory L. Morton and Catherine Koukladas, and in the USGS Geographic Information Systemlaboratory of the Mineral Resources Program of the U.S. Geological Survey in Spokane,Washington by Pamela M. Cossette, we received valuable assistance from Rachel Alvarez inRiverside, California, and from Paul C. Hyndman in Spokane, Washington.</datacred>

         <attraccr>Geologic-map units in the Devore quadrangle database were described using standard fieldmethods.  Consistent with these methods, the database author has assigned standardgeologic attributes to geologic lines, points, and polygons identified in the database.
Nation-wide geologic-map accuracy standards have not been developed and adopted by theU.S. Geological Survey and other earth-science entities.  Until such standards areadopted, the SCAMP project has developed internal map-accuracy standards for1:24,000-scale geologic maps produced by the project.
Geologic lines and points on 1:24,000 scale geologic maps are judged to meet SCAMP'sinternal map-accuracy standards if they are located to within +/-15 meters, relative totopographic or cultural features on the base map.
Lines and points that meet (or may not meet) this SCAMP internal map-accuracy standardare identified both in the digital database and on derivative geologic-map plots.Within the database, line and point data that are judged to meet the SCAMP internalmap-accuracy standard are denoted by the attribute code .MEE.  (meets) in theappropriate data table; line and point data that may not meet the SCAMP internalmap-accuracy standard are denoted by the attribute code .MNM. (may not meet).
On any derivative geologic-map plot, line data that are judged to meet the SCAMPinternal map-accuracy standard are denoted by solid lines; line data that may not meetthe SCAMP internal map-accuracy standard are denoted by dashed or dotted lines.  Thereis no cartographic device for denoting the map-accuracy for geologic-point data (eg.symbols representing bedding, foliation, lineations, etc.).</attraccr>

      <logic>Polygon and chain-node topology present.
The areal extent of the map is represented digitally by an appropriately projected(Polyconic projection), mathematically generated box.  Consequently, polygonsintersecting the lines that comprise the map boundary are closed by that boundary.Polygons internal to the map boundary are completely enclosed by line segments which arethemselves a set of sequentially numbered coordinate pairs.  Point data are representedby coordinate pairs.</logic>

      <overview>
         <eaover>Version 1.0 of the Devore 7.5' quadrangle comprises three ARC/INFO coverages, of whichtwo contain geologic data and one contains cartographic features: devre_geo (geology),devre_str (structural point data), and devre_ldr (annotation leaders).  Line and pointidentities are recorded in the .aat and .pat tables using a system of identity codes.Two INFO tables, lines.rel and points.rel provide a full description of each of thegeologic line and point codes in the database.  A full source citation is provided inthe Entity_and Attribute_Detail_Citation section of this metadata document.
Geologic data represented by line entities and the polygons they delineate are containedin the coverage DEVRE_GEO.  For display purposes, the geology coverage contains twoannotation subclasses: anno.geo contains unit labels, and anno.fault contains formal,fault names.
Geological point data includes site-specific information describing the types and theorientation of bedding, foliation, and lineations. One annotation subclass is includedin the geologic points coverage, DEVRE_STR: anno.dip displays the respective dip andplunge values associated with individual point data.</eaover>
         <eadetcit>A complete description of the polygon, line, and point data coding schemes is availablein U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Reports OFR 97-859, OFR 97-860, and OFR 97-861 (fullsource citations follow):
