         <abstract>High resolution orthorectified images combine the image characteristics of an aerial photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.  An orthoimage is a uniform-scale image where corrections have been made for feature displacement such as building tilt and for scale variations caused by terrain relief, sensor geometry, and camera tilt.  A mathematical equation based on ground control points, sensor calibration information, and a digital elevation model is applied to each pixel to rectify the image to obtain the geometric qualities of a map.

A digital orthoimage may be created from several photographs mosaicked to form the final image.  The source imagery may be black-and-white, natural color, color infrared, or color near infrared (4-band) with a pixel resolution of 1-meter or finer.  With orthoimagery, the resolution refers to the distance on the ground represented by each pixel.</abstract>
