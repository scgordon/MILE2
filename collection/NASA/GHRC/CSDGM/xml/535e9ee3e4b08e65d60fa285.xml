      <descript>
         <abstract>This map service includes geology, center points of oil and gas fields, geologic provinces, and political boundaries in the Former Soviet Union.  This compilation is part of an interim product of the U.S. Geological Survey's World Energy Project (WEP) and part of a series on CD-ROM.  The data sets were designed originally in ESRI's ARC/INFO ver. 7.0.4 and 7.1.2 system.
</abstract>
         <purpose>The data provides governments, the geological community, consultants, and the public with important information on the geological basis used to define provinces and oil and gas fields for USGS oil and gas assessments of the World.  The map is a visual summary of the data gathered for region 1.

Overall accuracy is based on accuracy of general geology coverage.  Since all the attributes are of character type, only correctness of polygon labelling can be provided (see below).
</attraccr>
         <qattracc>
            <attraccv>
Standard ARC/INFO attributes accuracy in Feature Attributes Tables like AREA, PERIMETER, etc. depend on horizontal positional accuracy.  All the additional attributes are character type.
</attraccv>
            <attracce>
All the Attributes besides standard ARC/INFO atttibutes are of character type.  Standard verification of attributes reliability has been done by ARC/INFO EDITPLOT program to find polygons without assigned character value or with more than one value.
</attracce>
         </qattracc>
      </attracc>
      <logic>
Since the data set is a collection of ARC/INFO coverages, topological consistency is supported.  The same fuzzy tolerance is maintained through all processing steps (1500).  Based on the fuzzy tolerance value all undershoots and overshoots were detected and deleted.  A visual comparison between a color plot and the original paper map was carried out.  Color plots in 1:7,500,000 scale were superimposed on each of corresponding original map sheets.  All errors detected in attributes were corrected.
</logic>
      <complete>
All data are found to be topologically correct.
The generalizations of original geological map (VSEGEI) were
carried out:
1. Several geological age subdivisions on the original (VSEGEI)
1:7,500,000 geological map are combined into single units.  For example, all Cretaceous are combined into one unit.
2. All the Precambrian subdivisions are combined into one
unit.
The version of Geologic Province Boundaries is correct as of April 1998.

1. Original geological maps are of 750 meter maximum accuracy (0.1 mm on paper map of 1:7,500,000 scale)
2. Scanned images are of 200 dot/inch resolution (0.1 mm on paper).  That is why fuzzy tolerance for CLEAN programm in ARC/INFO is set to 1500 m (two pixels).
3. Several steps are taken to vectorize scanned images.  The projection and coordinate system for the original map are not given. Therefore it is necessary to georeference the map to real world coordinates. This is done as follows:

3.1. The latitude/longitude graticule with cell size 4 * 6 degree is projected to Equidistant Conic projection and then used to create ARC/INFO point coverage.  That point coverage is used to create "to - from" links by ARC/INFO CONTROLPOINTS program.
3.2  A gray-scale scanned image of the original paper map is transformed to Equidistant Conic projection by ARC/INFO GRIDWARP program (polynomial of the second order) using the "to - from" links created by CONTROLPOINTS program.
3.3  The scanned image from the second step is vectorized by the method of extraction of linear features described by F.Persits, 1997, (USGS open-file report OF-97-713), and then corrected by hands-on digitization.
3.4  A series of piecewise "rubbersheet" transformations are applied to the final ARC/INFO coverage.  The ARC/INFO coverages that are used for transformation were ESRI's ArcWorld 1:3 million GIS cartographic layers.  Overall position error is estimated with a randomly selected set of locations on the ESRI coverages and comparing the same locations on the final geology coverage (geo1).  RMS error is 4.8 km (0.64 mm of the original paper map) with maximum error about 12 km (1.6 mm on original paper map).
