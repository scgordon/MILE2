         <abstract>Drilling-density cell maps show the number of wells that have been drilled into the storage assessment unit (SAU). Each 1-square-mile cell has a count for the number of unique well boreholes drilled into the SAU. For a given sedimentary basin, the USGS National Geologic CO2 Sequestration Assessment Project identifies SAUs containing the potential for storage and sequestration of carbon dioxide. Proprietary well header data from IHS ENERDEQ through 2010 were queried to determine which wells were drilled into specific SAUs. The coordinates of wells are proprietary and cannot be released; however, counts of the number of wells per square mile are presented in the well drilling density data layer.</abstract>
         <purpose>The purpose of the drilling-density cell map is to identify the amount of drilling that has occurred through 2010. The well density is the number of unique well boreholes drilled per square-mile cell into the storage assessment unit (SAU) as reported to or collected by IHS, Inc.  Drilling-density cell maps are generated for each SAU as part of the USGS National Geologic Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Sequestration Assessment Project.  In 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act (Public Law 110-140; see: http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/07/08/2010-16236/energy-independence-and-security-act-pub-l-110-140) authorized the USGS to conduct a national assessment of geologic storage resources for CO2.</purpose>
         <supplinf>Drilling-density cell maps for specific SAUs within the Bighorn Basin are listed below in Place Keywords by storage assessment unit code and name.  The following is a description of the online linkage URL: http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2012/1024/a/ —GIS data download page for Bighorn Basin CO2 Storage Assessment data (C5034).

         <attraccr>For the storage assessment unit, the nine-digit code identifies the USGS-specific storage assessment unit. The preceding letter "C" refers to a carbon dioxide storage assessment unit and distinguishes it from USGS National Oil and Gas Assessment Project assessment units that may have similar numbers. The first digit after "C" of the code indicates the world region number (5), the following three digits (034) are the North America province number, the following two digits (C5034xx) are the basin number, and the last two digits (C503401xx) are the storage assessment unit number of that particular basin. For each storage assessment unit, a well-density cell map displays the number of well penetrations per 1-square-mile cell into the storage formation.  For more detailed description of how the storage assessment unit boundary was drawn or the well-density cell map, refer to the Bighorn Basin Province Open-File Report by Covault and others (2012).</attraccr>
      </attracc>
      <logic>The drilling-density cell maps are derived from a compilation of well data in the proprietary IHS ENERDEQ database.  Individual wells are assessed to determine whether the well penetrated the storage assessment unit of interest.  Wells sharing the same well borehole are treated as a single penetration.  This storage-assessment-unit-penetrating subset of all wells is then compared to a national cell map to calculate the number of wells or the density of wells per 1-square-mile cell.  The cell density values have been compared to actual locations of wells.</logic>
      <complete>The drilling-density cell maps are complete to the extent that specific information was reported by the well driller and subsequently included in the proprietary IHS ENERDEQ database.  In the absence of reported data about the formation at total depth, oldest age penetrated, driller's total depth, true vertical depth, producing formation for initial production, completion and status information, and dates for spudding, completion, and abandonment, wells are conservatively eliminated from consideration for creating the drilling-density cell maps.  Old historical drilling or nonpetroleum industry wells might not be included in the IHS well database; however, the minimum depth to a storage assessment unit is 3,000 feet.</complete>
      <posacc>
         <horizpa>
            <horizpar>The drilling-density cell maps are derived from well data reported in the proprietary IHS ENERDEQ database.  Surface locations of wells are used to calculate the well density per 1-square-mile cell.  The horizontal accuracy depends on the accuracy of the position of the well reported in the database.  Drilling density based on the surface is an approximation of the drilling density on top of the structure of the storage assessment unit.</horizpar>

            <attrdef>The nine-digit code identifies the USGS-specific storage assessment unit. The preceding letter "C" refers to a carbon dioxide storage assessment unit and distinguishes it from USGS National Oil and Gas Assessment Project assessment units that may have similar numbers. The first digit after "C" of the code indicates the world region number (5), the following three digits (034) are the North America province number, the following two digits (C5034xx) are the basin number, and the last two digits (C503401xx) are the storage assessment unit number of that particular basin. For more detailed description of how the storage assessment unit boundary was drawn, refer to the Bighorn Basin Province Open-File Report by Covault and others (2012).</attrdef>

   <dataIdInfo>
      <idPurp>The purpose of the drilling-density cell map is to identify the amount of drilling that has occurred through 2010. The well density is the number of unique well boreholes drilled per square mile cell into the storage assessment unit (SAU) as reported to or collected by IHS, Inc.  Drilling density cell maps are generated for each SAU as part of the USGS National Geologic Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Sequestration Assessment Project.  In 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act (Public Law 110-140; see: http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/07/08/2010-16236/energy-independence-and-security-act-pub-l-110-140) authorized the USGS to conduct a national assessment of geologic storage resources for CO2.</idPurp>
      <idAbs>&lt;DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;"&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Drilling-density cell maps show the number of wells that have been drilled into the storage assessment unit (SAU). Each 1 square-mile cell has a count for the number of unique well boreholes drilled into the SAU. For a given sedimentary basin, the USGS Geologic CO2 Sequestration Assessment Project identifies SAUs containing the potential for storage and sequestration of carbon dioxide. Proprietary well header data from IHS ENERDEQ through 2010 were queried to determine which wells were drilled into specific SAUs. The coordinates of wells are proprietary and cannot be released; however, counts of the number of wells per square mile are presented in the well drilling density data layer.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</idAbs>
