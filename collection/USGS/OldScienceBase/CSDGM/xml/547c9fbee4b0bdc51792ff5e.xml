      <descript>
         <abstract>Aeromagnetic data were collected along flight lines by instruments in an
aircraft that recorded magnetic-field values and locations. In the earlier
days of surveying, the only way to represent this data was to generate an
analog map with contour lines. This dataset is a representation of the
digitized contour lines either by following the lines or by choosing the
intersection of the contour and flight-line to create a value of the magnetic
field. The values presented are latitude, longitude, and map magnetic-field
values.</abstract>
         <purpose>Aeromagnetic surveys are used for geophysical prospecting.  Some variations in
magnetic measurements are caused by rocks that contain significant amounts of
magnetic minerals (magnetite being the most common).  These anomalies reflect
variations in the amount and type of magnetic material and the shape and depth
of the body of rock. The features and patterns of aeromagnetic anomalies can
also be used to delineate details of subsurface geology including the locations
of buried faults and the thickness of surficial sedimentary rocks.</purpose>

         <attraccr>The data shown on the original map have been processed using various
formulas and methods that are not usually documented but that represent
industry standard practices for airborne data reduction.  For example,
position is listed as latitude and longitude, but these values were
derived from the raw navigation data depending on the system used.
(see notes under horizontal accuracy). Line numbers were added to
records, and unusable data at flight-line ends were discarded
(as aircraft slowed and turned around). Separate recordings were
correlated by time and assigned to the correct location.
The exact accuracies of these processing steps may not be known.  They
are discussed in the sections on attribute or positional accuracies.</attraccr>
      </attracc>
      <logic>The data on the original map were collected by a single contractor or group
who were responsible for collecting and processing the data.
The data from this survey were collected using the same instruments
(magnetometers, altimeters, navigational systems) throughout
the survey and were collected in a normal length of time with no long
delays between survey beginning and end.
Survey layout specified the conditions and specifications under which
these data were collected.  Standard industry practices of the time
were followed in data collection and processing.</logic>

            <horizpar>Flight Path Recovery
Horizontal position of the survey aircraft used to collect
data were determined by reconciling down-looking photographs
(recorded on continuous-strip film) with topographic maps
and orthophotoquadrangle maps.  Fiducial numbers and marks,
impressed on any paper strips that were recording data or
added to magnetic tape records, were included as a function of
time to further reconcile location with instrumentation.</horizpar>

            <vertaccr>The aircraft vertical position was determined using the
navigational positioning equipment on the aircraft, which
