         <abstract>Oblique images snapped from a Canon Rebel 3Ti with a Sigma zoom lens (18-200mm focal length), a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 (24x superzoom with variable focal length) and a Panasonic Lumix DMC-SZ7 (10x superzoom with variable focal length) of the arctic landscape during low altitude transects. Transects were conducted from small aircraft over the National Park Service’s Arctic Network (Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, Cape Krusenstern National Monument, Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, Kobuk Valley National Park, and Noatak National Preserve) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Selawik National Wildlife Refuge in northwest Alaska.</abstract>
         <purpose>Provide images of current conditions and prevalence of land cover types as a baseline for measuring future change, and to complement the existing grid-based sample photography of the region.</purpose>
         <supplinf>Images include an EXIF (exchangeable image file format) file that delineates camera metadata for each image.</supplinf>

         <descgeog>The study area included five units of the National Park Service’s Arctic Network (Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, Cape Krusenstern National Monument, Gates of the Arctic National Park &amp; Preserve, Kobuk Valley National Park, and Noatak National Preserve), the adjacent area of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Selawik National Wildlife Refuge, and a 10-km buffer around all of these administrative units, totaling 162,868 km2 in an area spanning roughly 500 km east to west and 300 km north to south.  This is also the study area for the USGS’ Wildlife Potential Habitat Forecasting Framework Project (WildCast) that projects effects of climate change on future land cover and wildlife habitat (DeGange et al. 2013)</descgeog>

            <methdesc>Oblique and nadir photographs and videos were shot along flight routes conducted July 16, 17, and 18, 2013, totaling 17 h 46 m flight time and 2,590 km flight distance, at a mean altitude of approximately 300 m above ground level.  Flight routes were selected to provide a broad representation of land cover types within each unit and to overfly specific locations of recent disturbances.  Photographs were geotagged, and photographs and videos were corrected for image lens distortion and appearance.</methdesc>

Then, the difference between flight altitude above mean sea level (determined enroute via the on-board GPS unit) and ground-level elevation gave flight elevation above ground level for all photographs, which was used to verify the mean flight elevation used in the calculations of photograph time-lapse intervals and areal coverage of each photograph.</procdesc>
