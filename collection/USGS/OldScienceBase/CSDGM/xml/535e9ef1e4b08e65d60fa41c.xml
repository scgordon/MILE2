      <descript>
         <abstract>Cell maps for each oil and gas assessment unit were created by the USGS to illustrate the degree of exploration, type of production, and distribution of production in an assessment unit or province. Each cell represents a quarter-mile square of the land surface, and the cells are coded to represent whether the wells included within the cell are predominantly oil-producing, gas-producing, both oil and gas-producing, dry, or the type of production of the wells located within the cell is unknown. The well information was initially retrieved from the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data on CD-ROM, which is a proprietary, commercial database containing information for most oil and gas wells in the U.S.  Cells were developed as a graphic solution to overcome the problem of displaying proprietary PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data.  No proprietary data are displayed or included in the cell maps.  The data from PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data are current as of 2003.</abstract>
         <purpose>The purpose of the cell map is to display the exploration maturity, type of production, and distribution of production in quarter-mile cells in each of the oil and gas assessment units and each of the provinces defined for the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project.</purpose>
         <supplinf>Oil and gas assessment units within the Upper Cretaceous Taylor and Navarro Groups, province 047 (Western Gulf Province) are listed here by assessment unit number and name:

&gt;50470103 Travis Volcanic Mounds Oil
&gt;50470104 Uvalde Volcanic Mounds Gas and Oil
&gt;50470105 Navarro-Taylor Updip Oil and Gas
&gt;50470106 Navarro-Taylor Downdip Gas and Oil
&gt;50470107 Navarro-Taylor Slope-Basin Gas

      <logic>The accuracy of the cells, as created by the Arc Macro Language (AML) program of L.R.H. Biewick, S. Weiler and C.C. Skinner, depends upon the accuracy of the oil and gas well information in the 2003 version of the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data. For the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project, the assumption was made that the data in PI/Dwights PLUS were of sufficient accuracy for such a national-scale analysis.</logic>
      <complete>The cells were defined using the 2003 well data in the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS. The PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data contains over two million, nine hundred thousand wells for the U.S., which, although not a complete tabulation of all U.S. wells, is the most complete well database available for the United States.</complete>

            <procdesc>Wells that have a reported occurrence of formations of the Upper Cretaceous Taylor and Navarro Groups were retrieved from PI/Dwights Plus, a trademark of Petroleum Information/Dwights, d.b.a. IHS Energy Group. Data are current as of 2003. The boundaries of the assessment units were determined by Dyman and Condon, and were drawn on the basis of geologic characteristics and conditions favorable for hydrocarbon generation and accumulation-such as source, reservoir, and seal rocks; burial, thermal, and migration histories; and trapping mechanisms-that combine to distinguish them from each other. The hypothetical assessment unit was defined to include areas where potential source or reservoir rocks occur, but where no oil or gas from the Taylor or Navarro Groups has been produced. Wells shown as dry may produce oil or gas from other formations.</procdesc>

            <procdesc>Oil and gas well data for each assessment unit were run through an Arc Macro Language (AML) program written by L.R.H. Biewick, S. Weiler, and C.C. Skinner. This program aggregated and converted the 2003 PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data into quarter-mile cells and latitude-longitude points that represent the center-points of the quarter-mile cells.  The assessment unit cells were then assigned an attribute based on the type of production of the wells located within the cell.  Region, province, total petroleum system, and assessment unit codes and names were appended to the file using lookup information acquired from tables created for the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project.</procdesc>
