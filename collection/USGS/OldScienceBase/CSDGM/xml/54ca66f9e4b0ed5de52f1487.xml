         <abstract>USGS and Non USGS Agencies Aerial Photo Reference Mosaics inventory contains indexes to aerial photographs.  The inventory contains imagery from various government agencies that are now archived at the USGS Earth Resources Observation &amp; Science (EROS) Center.  The film types, scales, and acquisition schedules differed according to project requirements. Low-, middle-, and high-altitude photographs were collected. </abstract>
         <purpose>The Aerial Photo Mosaics were generated from aerial photos collected by flight contractors and submitted to the USGS and other agencies in support of map compilation and revision projects.  They now serve as a valuable historical reference for the scientific community and general public to use in conjunction with more recent imagery.</purpose>

         <attraccr>Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the photo image. Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during a mosaicing process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images to improve their tone.</attraccr>

            <procdesc>Aerial Photos - USGS and Non USGS Photo Mosaics are acquired by several government
agencies and the military.  Aircraft used to collect these photos may include
General Dynamic's WB-57F; Lockheed C-130B and NP-3A aircraft;  Lockheed U-2s
and Convair 990 aircraft; and other commercial aircraft. Some of the cameras
used on past missions include Zeiss, Hasselblad EL 500, Wild Heerbrugg RC8,
and Chicago Aerial KA 62. </procdesc>
