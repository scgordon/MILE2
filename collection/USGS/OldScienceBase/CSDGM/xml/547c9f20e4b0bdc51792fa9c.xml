         <abstract>Aeromagnetic data were collected along flight lines by instruments in an
aircraft that recorded magnetic-field values and locations.  This dataset
presents latitude, longitude, altitude, and magnetic-field values.</abstract>
         <purpose>Aeromagnetic surveys are used for geophysical prospecting.  Some
variations in magnetic measurements are caused by rocks that
contain significant amounts of magnetic minerals (magnetite being
the most common).  These anomalies reflect variations in the
amount and type of magnetic material and the shape and depth of
the body of rock.
Aeromagnetic anomaly maps are important tools in mapping
surficial and buried igneous rocks.  The features and patterns
of aeromagnetic anomalies can also be used to delineate details
of subsurface geology including the locations of buried faults and
the thickness of surficial sedimentary rocks.</purpose>
         <supplinf>The U.S. Geological Survey has contracted or flown numerous
airborne surveys over a long period (1950's to present).  Not
all flight-line data have been released to the public
because of lack of personnel to reformat data and service the
requests.  With the improvement in digital communication
and the ability to store and transmit large data sets, the
USGS is now able to release the flight-line data in a
common format.
A companion CD-ROM/web site has been released containing
magnetic data that were generated by digitizing analog maps.
Digital flight-line data used to create the analog maps are
unavailable.  Reference is in the Cross-Reference section of
this metadata file.</supplinf>

      <attracc>
         <attraccr>The data in this file have been processed using various formulas and
methods that are not usually documented but that represent
industry standard practices for airborne data reduction.  For example,
position is listed as latitude and longitude, but these values
were derived from the raw navigation data depending on the system used.
(see notes under horizontal accuracy). Line numbers were added to
records, and unusable data at flight-line ends were discarded
(as aircraft slowed and turned around). Separate recordings were
correlated by time and assigned to the correct location.
The exact accuracies of these processing steps may not be known.
They are discussed in the sections on attribute or positional
accuracies.</attraccr>
      </attracc>
      <logic>The data in this file were collected by a single contractor or group
who were responsible for collecting and processing the data.
The data from this survey were collected using the same instruments
(magnetometers, altimeters, navigational systems) throughout
the survey and were collected in a normal length of time with no long
delays between survey beginning and end.
Survey contracts specified the conditions and specifications under which
these data were collected.  Standard industry practices of the time
were followed in data collection and processing.</logic>
      <complete>Loss of data due to poor transmission, channel dropout, obvious spiking,
missing channels, and other obvious errors were replaced with the
value -9999.9, such as in the barometric altimeter (barom) and total
magnetic field (totmag) channels.
A dummy value of -1 was used in the flight line direction
(directn) in order to conform to the established template.
Line 190 is missing from the database.</complete>
      <posacc>
         <horizpa>
            <horizpar>Flight Path Recovery
Horizontal position of the survey aircraft used to collect
data were determined by reconciling down-looking photographs
(recorded on continuous-strip film) with topographic maps
and orthophotoquadrangle maps.  Fiducial numbers and marks,
impressed on any paper strips that were recording data or
added to magnetic tape records, were included
as a function of time to further reconcile location with
instrumentation.</horizpar>
         </horizpa>
         <vertacc>
            <vertaccr>The aircraft vertical position was determined using the
navigational positioning equipment on the aircraft, which
were radar altimeter and barometric altimeter.
Radar altimeters are estimated to have an error
of 2-5% of the altitude (Richard Hansen, PRJ, Inc.,
written communication).
Barometric altimeters are quite accurate, but are
typically operated in an uncorrected mode.  The
diurnal variation in air pressure over the course of
a flight can produce a 50-100 ft error in the
barometric altimeter reading.  In addition, pressure microcells
create short-period air pressure changes equivalent
to about 10 ft under typical conditions (Richard
Hansen, PRJ, Inc., written communication)
The magnetometer was carried in a bird towed on a
line that was approximately 50-100 feet below the aircraft.
The bird as it is towed is slightly behind the aircraft
and therefore the vertical distance between the magnetometer
and the aircraft is slightly less than the length of the line
but remains constant for the survey.
This data set was collected at a draped survey having a
average terrain clearance of 400 ft.  Because aircraft,
especially airplanes, cannot safely maintain a constant
terrain clearance, error in vertical position is
introduced.</vertaccr>

            <procdesc>Conversion of measured values to geographic position and
magnetic values was performed by the contractor using
industry standard practices.
Details are found under Attribute Accuracy Report,
Horizontal_Position_Accuracy_Report, and

Unless noted, conversion processes were not reported to the USGS.
Unpublished products generated by the contractor included magnetic
tapes, a map of residual or total field magnetics, and perhaps some

            <procdesc>USGS reformatting of contractor data to standard format.
USGS personnel used the software package Oasis Montaj version 4.3 by
Geosoft, Inc., to read in the original contractor's data.
Latitude, longitude, altitude, and magnetic values were
checked for obvious errors or spikes and values of -9999.9
were given where the value could not be reasonably corrected.
Other errors in the data were not corrected.  Horizontal positions
were converted to latitude and longitude if the original values
were UTM meters.  Elevations were converted from meters to feet
(1 m = 3.2808 ft).  Information was added that was missing from the
data file but was recorded elsewhere.  The reformatted data file was
written in the format described in the section on
Entity_and_Attribute_Overview.</procdesc>

            <attrdef>Raw magnetic value with base magnetometer corrections applied.
Because the magnetic field of the earth varies diurnally,
a stationary base magnetometer is maintained on the ground
during airborne surveying.  The base magnetometer records
changes in the magnetic field (in nanoTeslas) as a function
of time.  The magnetic changes may have an amplitude of 20
to 50 nanoTeslas.  If changes are more severe, as would
occur from a magnetic storm, surveying is discontinued or
the data recorded are not used.
Diurnal variations are then removed from the airborne magnetic
data based on the common time.
Values of -9999.9 indicate missing data.</attrdef>

            <attrdef>residual magnetic value
The total magnetic value minus a geomagnetic reference field (GRF),
which is a long-wavelength regional magnetic field.  The most commonly
used reference field is determined from a model developed by the
International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA).  The
International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF), is a predictive model
adopted at the beginning of a model period (e.g. in 1989 for
1990-1995).  After the model period, a revised definitive model is
adopted, the DGRF. This is the preferred model to use for removing
regional magnetic fields.
For this survey, the field removed was the IGRF 1975 updated to the
period of flying.
