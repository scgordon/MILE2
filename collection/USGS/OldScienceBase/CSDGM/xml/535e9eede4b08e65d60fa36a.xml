         <abstract>Cell maps for each oil and gas assessment unit were created by the USGS as a method for illustrating the degree of exploration, type of production, and distribution of production in an assessment unit or province. A cell map was not created for the Menefee Coal-Bed Gas (50220381) assessment unit because it was considered a hypothetical assessment unit. The Mesaverde Updip oil had production wells associated with it but resource totals were below the minimum and wasn't quantitatively assessed. Each cell represents a quarter-mile square of the land surface, and the cells are coded to represent whether the wells included within the cell are predominantly oil-producing, gas-producing, both oil and gas-producing, dry, or the type of production of the wells located within the cell is unknown. The well information was initially retrieved from the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data on CD-ROM, which is a proprietary, commercial database containing information for most oil and gas wells in the U.S.  Cells were developed as a graphic solution to overcome the problem of displaying proprietary PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data. No proprietary data are displayed or included in the cell maps.  The data from PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data were current as of October 2001 when the cell maps were created in 2002.</abstract>
         <purpose>The purpose of the cell map is to display the exploration maturity, type of production, and distribution of production in quarter-mile cells in each of the oil and gas assessment units and each of the provinces defined for the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project.</purpose>

      <logic>The accuracy of the cells, as created by the Arc Macro Language (AML) program of L.R.H. Biewick, S. Weiler and C. Skinner, depends upon the accuracy of the oil and gas well information in the 2001 version of the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data. For the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project, the assumption was made that the data in PI/Dwights PLUS were of sufficient accuracy for such a national-scale analysis.</logic>
      <complete>The cells were defined using the 2001 well data in the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS. The PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data contains over two million, nine hundred thousand wells for the U.S., which, although not a complete tabulation of all U.S. wells, is the most complete well database available for the United States.</complete>

The province geologist mapped the Assessment Unit boundary on a hard copy base map at 1:2,000,000 provided by the project that contained data from IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data (2001 update), and the Nehring Significant Oil and Gas Field File (2001 update).  The province geologist then plotted all other available geologic and geophysical well data and information on the hard copy base map to assist in mapping the Assessment Unit boundary.  Following review, the Assessment Unit boundary was digitally transferred from the hard copy base map using ArcMap.

            <procdesc>Oil and gas well data for the U.S. were run through an Arc Macro Language (AML) program written by L.R.H. Biewick, S. Weiler, and C. Skinner. This program aggregated and converted the 2001 PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data into quarter-mile cells and latitude-longitude points that represent the center-points of the quarter-mile cells.  For each of the Assessment Units, cells were isolated from the national coverage based on the Assessment Unit wells.  The Assessment Unit cells were then assigned an attribute based on the type of production of the wells located within the cell.  Region, province, total petroleum system, and assessment unit codes and names were appended to the file using lookup information acquired from tables created for the National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project.</procdesc>
