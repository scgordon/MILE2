         <abstract>The first release of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data was provided in 1-degree digital elevation model (DEM) tiles from the USGS 2003. The data was released continent by continent, as and when the data was processed by NASA and the USGS. For the United States, data was made available at 1-arc second resolution (approximately 30m at the equator), but for the rest of the world the 1-arc second product is degraded to 3-arc seconds (approximately 90m at the equator). SRTM elevation data has now been released for the entire terrestrial surface, and a Finished product has now been released.</abstract>

         <attraccr> The identification of features is provided by the distinct electromagnetic energy it emits,reflects, or otherwise transmits.  This is called the spectral signature.  Other signatures such as tone (lightness or darkness), texture (surface roughness or smoothness), pattern,shadow, shape, and size are as important.  Thus, through the use of the thematic mapper sensor, such elements as water features, soils, and vegetation can be identified and distinguished from each other.</attraccr>
