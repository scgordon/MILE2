         <abstract>MODIS/Terra+Aqua Land Cover Type Yearly L3 Global 0.05Deg CMG
The Land Cover Type Yearly Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) is a lower spatial resolution (0.05?) product, which provides the dominant land cover type and also the sub-grid frequency distribution of land cover classes. The CMG product (Short name: MCD12C1) is derived using the same algorithm that produces the V005 Global 500 m Land Cover Type product (MCD12Q1). It contains three classification schemes, which describe the land cover properties derived from observations spanning a year?s input of Terra and Aqua MODIS data. The primary land cover scheme identifies 17 land cover classes defined by the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP), which includes 11 natural vegetation classes, 3 developed and mosaicked land classes, and 3 non-vegetated land classes. It includes the following three classification schemes, derived through a supervised decision-tree classification method:
Land Cover Type 1: IGBP global vegetation classification scheme 
Land Cover Type 3: MODIS-derived LAI/FPAR scheme 
Land Cover Type 2: University of Maryland (UMD) scheme 
Additional layers include a Land Cover Type Assessment SDS, a Land Cover Percent SDS, and a Land Cover Quality Control SDS.
Information on each individual MODIS Platform/Product are available at: https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/lpdaac/products/modis_products_table</abstract>

         <attraccr>The identification of features is provided by the distinct electromagnetic energy it emits, reflects, or otherwise transmits.  This is called the spectral signature. Other signatures such as tone (lightness or darkness), texture (surface roughness or smoothness), pattern, shadow, shape, and size are as important. Thus, through the use of remote sensing technologies, such elements as water features, soils, and vegetation can be identified and distinguished from each other. </attraccr>
