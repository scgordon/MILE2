      <descript>
         <abstract>This digital geologic map of the Nevada Test Site (NTS) and vicinity, as well as its accompanying digital geophysical maps, are compiled at 1:100,000 scale.  The map compilation presents new polygon (geologic map unit contacts), line (fault, fold axis, metamorphic isograd, dike, and caldera wall) and point (structural attitude) vector data for the NTS and vicinity, Nye, Lincoln, and Clark Counties, Nevada, and Inyo County, California.  The map area covers two 30 x 60-minute quadrangles-the Pahute Mesa quadrangle to the north and the Beatty quadrangle to the south-plus a strip of 7.5-minute quadrangles on the east side-72 quadrangles in all.  In addition to the NTS, the map area includes the rest of the southwest Nevada volcanic field, part of the Walker Lane, most of the Amargosa Desert, part of the Funeral and Grapevine Mountains, some of Death Valley, and the northern Spring Mountains.  This geologic map improves on previous geologic mapping of the same area (Wahl and others, 1997) by providing new and updated Quaternary and bedrock geology, new geophysical interpretations of faults beneath the basins, and improved GIS coverages.  Concurrent publications to this one include a new isostatic gravity map (Ponce and others, 1999) and a new aeromagnetic map (Ponce, 1999).</abstract>
         <purpose>The primary purpose of the three maps is to provide an updated geologic framework to aid development of hydrologic models for the Death Valley regional ground-water flow system study in support of the Department of Energy (DOE) activities at the NTS.</purpose>
         <supplinf>The following ARC/INFO coverages are related to the main database and are included with the data set.

   <dataqual>
      <attracc>
         <attraccr>Attributes were carried over from the older version (Revision 3) of the database (see Wahl and others, 1997) and converted to our attribution scheme.  New data was attributed both by the geologists making the observations (field observations and/or air photo interpretation) and by GIS specialists using 1:24,000-scale and 1:60,000-scale maps annotated by the geologists.  The database was thoroughly reviewed by the authors and other geologists familiar with the geology of the area on 1:24,000-scale and 1:60,000-scale printouts of the map.  This database is an accurate representation of their interpretation of the geology.  The database was also reviewed by selected authors (GIS specialists) and USGS GIS specialists.  Frequency and label-error tests were run on all attributes of all coverages to assure against unattributed and improperly attributed entities.  Errors found as a result of these tests were then corrected and tests run again until no errors were found.  Within the fault coverage, faults of unkown, uncertain, or undifferentiated displacement are attributed with "FTYPCODE = 70".  In many cases, the displacement on these faults is known and indicated by bar-and-ball (dip-slip) and/or arrow (strike-slip) symbols in the R4-FAULTS-SYM coverage included with the dataset but the fault lines were not attributed with a specific fault-type-code (FTYPCODE).  All attributed linework follows the right-hand-rule such that all line decoration symbols (barbs, teeth, etc.) are to the right of the arc facing in the direction of the arc.</attraccr>
      </attracc>
      <logic>New linework was digitized at 1:24,000-scale from stable base maps, at 1:80,000-scale from air photos, and at 1:100,000-scale from stable base maps.  All new mapping was visually checked and reviewed by the authors at 1:24,000-scale and all of the database was checked and reviewed at 1:60,000-scale for improperly intersecting lines, double lines, overshoots, undershoots, and inconsistency in mapping coverage and detail.  Data included from the 1:100,000-scale source database (Wahl and others, 1997) was also checked and reviewed at 1:60,000-scale and logical inconsistencies were corrected.  Coverages were built and cleaned in ARC/INFO version 7.1.2 after completion of all edits.  The logical consistency is topologically clean for all coverages.</logic>
      <complete>This dataset includes only the coverages pertaining to the geologic map.  Any margin material on the printed map (correlation chart, explanation of map symbols) is not included.  A basemap line coverage produced from scanned topographic maps is included (NTS-BASE).  This map was produced to be used at 1:100,000-scale and has been generalized from more detailed mapping.  Any geologic features too small to be shown at this scale have been omitted or generalized if they are of significant importance.  The smallest objects are approximately 45 to 50 meters on a side.</complete>

            <horizpar>The reported horizontal positional accuracy for the source data (Wahl and others, 1997) is 15 meters for the linework which was vectorized from a raster scan of the source maps.  The estimated horizontal positional accuracy of the new data is 15 to 20 meters.  The accuracy of the geophysically defined structures (R4-GPFLTS) is less certain because their position is based upon interpretation of high gradients in the gravity data (published as a companion to this open-file report; Ponce and others, 1999).  The horizontal position of these structures can be significantly affected by basin depth and the dip of the structure.  The accuracy for these structures is highest where they have surface expressions (ie fault scarps, surface lineaments, and coincedence with previously mapped structures included in the coverage R4-FAULTS).  The lowest accuracy is indicated by the line attribute "CODE = 2".  Because the source data (Wahl and others, 1997) was vectorized from separate scans of the faults and geology polygons, the linework is not always exactly coincident where it should be (where faults act as unit polygon boundaries).  We attempted to improve the accuracy of these lines between the fault (R4-FAULTS) and geology (R4-GEOLOGY) coverages but at scales greater than 1:100,000-scale, these inconsistancies may become more visible.  This database was produced to be used at 1:100,000-scale and any problems arising from use at other scales are not the responsibilities of the authors.  No vertical data is included in the database (basemap elevations are reproductions of published USGS topographic maps).</horizpar>

R4-GEOLOGY-------LINES/POLYGONS-----Contains geologic contacts and unit labeled polygons.  Line entities attributed with standard ARC/INFO attributes only.  Polygon entities attributed with UNIT (unit symbol from description of map units in text) and SYMBOL (unit color value from alc1.shd shadeset).
R4-META----------POLYGONS-----------Contains areal extent of metamorphism in bedrock.  Attributed with INDEX (numerical code for polygons of metamorphism).
R4-FAULTS--------LINES--------------Contains mapped fault lines.  Line entities attributed with FSYMBOL (unique numerical code for each fault type), FSRCCODE (numerical code for description of fault exposure/source), and FTYPCODE (numerical code for type of fault).
R4-GPFLTS--------LINES--------------Contains geologic structures identified by interpretation of gravity data.  Line entities attributed with CODE (numerical code for structure type), LABEL (text item with structure name where appropriate), and INDEX (numerical code indicating whether structure has a value for LABEL).
R4-TZONE---------LINES--------------Contains line indicating axial trace of a transverse zone located based upon several lines of evidence (see text).  Line entity attributed with LABEL (text item labeling the transverse zone).
R4-FOLDS---------LINES--------------Contains fold axes as line entities.  Attributed with CODE (numerical code for fold exposure and type; anticline/syncline).
R4-CALDERAS------LINES--------------Contains caldera walls as line entities.  Attributed with CODE (numerical code for exposure type) and LABEL (text item with abbreviated name of caldera and wall type).
R4-ATTITUDES-----LINES--------------Contains lines to graphically display bedding attitude symbols and dip values.  Line entities have only standard ARC/INFO attributes.
The attributes in the R4-GEOLOGY coverage are defined as:UNIT is a text string refering to the unit symbols used in the description of map units text provided with the map.SYMBOL is a number refering to author selected colors in the ARC/INFO shadeset alc1.shd available upon request.
