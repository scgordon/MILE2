         <abstract>
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has generated topographic moisture potential classes for the contiguous United States. These topographic moisture potential classes were created as part of an effort to map standardized, terrestrial ecosystems for the nation using a classification developed by NatureServe (Comer and others, 2003). Ecosystem distributions were modeled using a biophysical stratification approach developed for South America (Sayre and others, 2008) and now being implemented globally (Sayre and others, 2007). Substrate moisture regimes strongly influence the differentiation and distribution of terrestrial ecosystems, and are one of the key input layers in the ecosystem delineation process. The method used to produce these classes is based on the derivation of ground moisture potential using a combination of computed topographic characteristics and mapped wetlands boundaries. This method does not use climate or soil attributes to calculate relative topographic moisture potential since these characteristics are incorporated into the ecosystems though other input layers.

The source data for this assessment is a national Compound Topographic Index (CTI) dataset (USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science Center, 2003), which was derived from the USGS 30-meter National Elevation Dataset (NED). The CTI index is a topographically derived measure of slope for a raster cell and the contributing area from "upstream" raster cells, and thus expresses potential for water flow to a point. This potential accumulation at a point was compared to independent estimates of water accumulation by obtaining geospatial data from a number of sample locations representing wetland/upland boundaries from the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) dataset. Where these "shorelines" (the interface between wetlands and adjacent land) occurred, the CTI values were extracted and a histogram of their statistical distributions was calculated. Based on an evaluation of these histograms, CTI thresholds were developed to separate wetlands from uplands. A similar process was used to assess the distributions of CTI values for known locations of mesic and dry uplands. After the range of CTI values for these three different substrate moisture regimes (wetlands, mesic uplands, and dry uplands) was determined, the CTI values were recalculated to topographic moisture potential. The final step in the generation of the national topographic moisture potential data layer was to partition the dry uplands class into two classes, a dry uplands class, and a very dry uplands class. Very dry uplands were defined as dry uplands with relatively steep, south-facing slopes, and identification of this class was based on the slope and aspect datasets derived from the USGS NED. The resulting Topographic Moisture Potential dataset for the contiguous United States contains four classes: wetlands, mesic uplands, dry uplands, and very dry uplands.

This is an interim product generated as an input layer in the geospatial delineation of ecosystems and should not be construed, in and of itself, as a "definitive" product. This product could be improved in terms of strength of concept, quality of source data, and spatial resolution and should therefore be considered as representative of a first iteration attempt to use best available data for modeling standardized ecosystems.

This effort to map standardized, meso-scale ecosystems for both the conterminous United States and Africa is the first of its kind, and represents a biophysical stratification. The data developed for this mapping process were not all of the same quality or spatial resolution, but each dataset obtained and used for the mapping was considered to be "best available data" for that theme at a National extent. The primary goal for the first round of this mapping effort was to utilize the best source data currently available to generate a first iteration of ecosystems as quickly as possible. This goal was framed on the logic that reasonably robust and satisfactory results could be obtained from this method without a multi-year, million-plus dollar investment, and the methodology would therefore prove suitable for application in the global ecosystems mapping project under GEOSS.

Based on the nature of this first iteration of products, the following potential issue has already been identified for the Topographic Moisture Potential data layer generated for the conterminous United States:

Data artifact transfer from CTI source data to Topographic Moisture Potential:

This dataset was derived from the Compound Topographic Index (CTI) dataset, which was itself a derivative product of the National Elevation Dataset (NED), created by the Elevation Derivatives for National Applications (EDNA) project. Therefore any data artifacts found in either the CTI dataset or NED were inherited in the Topographic Moisture Potential dataset. These artifacts appear as grid patterns in the Topographic Moisture Potential and can be found in areas of flatter terrain. The Topographic Moisture Potential dataset also includes small occurrences of No Data areas, with a pixel value of zero, based on No Data areas in the CTI dataset. No attempt was made to eliminate these artifacts or No Data pixels from the derived dataset; however, additional efforts are planned to research the effects of these issues.

            <srccontr>Provided a quantification of the position of a site in the local landscape as a step in the process of generating Topographic Moisture Potential (Cress and others, 2009c).</srccontr>

            <procdesc>The topographic moisture potential for the conterminous United States was derived to help contribute substrate moisture regimes into the ecosystems model (Cress and others, 2009c). The method used to produce these topographic moisture potential classes was based on the derivation of ground moisture potential using a combination of computed topographic characteristics (CTI, slope, and aspect) and mapped National Wetland Inventory boundaries. This method does not use climate or soil attributes to calculate relative topographic moisture potential since these characteristics are incorporated into the ecosystem model though other input layers. All of the topographic data used for this assessment was derived from the USGS 30-meter NED including the National Compound Topographic Index. The CTI index is a topographically derived measure of slope for a raster cell and the contributing area from upstream raster cells, and thus expresses potential for water flow to a point. In other words CTI data are "a quantification of the position of a site in the local landscape", where the lowest values indicate ridges and the highest values indicate stream channels, lakes and ponds (USGS, 2003). These CTI values were compared to independent estimates of water accumulation by obtaining geospatial data from a number of sample locations representing two types of NWI boundaries, Freshwater Emergent Wetlands and Freshwater Forested/Shrub Wetlands. Where these shorelines (the interface between the NWI wetlands and adjacent land) occurred, the CTI values were extracted and a histogram of their statistical distributions was calculated. Based on an evaluation of these histograms, CTI thresholds were developed to separate periodically saturated or flooded land, mesic uplands (moderately moist), and uplands. After the range of CTI values for these three different substrate moisture regimes was determined, the CTI values were grouped into three initial topographic moisture potential classes. As a final step in the generation of this national data layer, the uplands classification was further broken down into either very dry uplands or dry uplands. Very dry uplands were defined as uplands with relatively steep, south-facing slopes, and identification of this class was based on the slope and aspect datasets derived from the USGS NED. The remaining uplands that did not meet these additional criteria were simply re-classified as dry uplands. The final National Topographic Moisture Potential dataset for the conterminous United States contains four classes: periodically saturated or flooded land (CTI &gt;= 18.5), mesic uplands (12 &lt;= CTI &lt; 18.5), dry uplands (CTI &lt; 12), and very dry uplands (CTI &lt; 12, Slope &gt; 24 degrees and 91 degrees &lt;= Aspect &lt;= 314 degrees).</procdesc>
