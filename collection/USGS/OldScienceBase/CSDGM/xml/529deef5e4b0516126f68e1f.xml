         <abstract>
Several bureaus within the Department of Interior compiled available information from seabird observation datasets from the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf into a single database, with the goal of conducting research and informing coastal and offshore planning activities. The cooperators were the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) Environmental Studies Program (http://www.boem.gov/Environmental-Stewardship/Environmental-Studies/Environmental-Studies.aspx), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) Division of Migratory Bird Management (http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/) and the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov). The resulting product is the Atlantic Offshore Seabird Dataset Catalog, which characterizes the survey effort and bird observations that have been collected across space and time. Currently, the database contains ~60 datasets from 1906-2009 with over 260,000 records of seabird observations. Data will initially be provided as summary web mapping services, with web feature services (for downloading and looking at single-species data) at the linkage given elsewhere in this document.  USAGE:
Seabirds provide unique challenges even when using estimation techniques to sample populations (e.g., Tasker et al. 1984, Spear et al. 1992).  To date, there has been little consistency among survey designs.  Surveys have varied by the type of vessel from which they are conducted (ship, plane), the methodology that counts are made, the width of the area being counted, and equipment used, among many other differences. Under such circumstances, comparing results and making inferences can be difficult. Because these estimates of effort-adjusted counts do not account for detection probability, they are likely biased by factors that affect this parameter such as weather, survey method, observer, or other environmental variables (MacKenzie et al. 2006).  Such results may be considered naïve in that they do not account for factors that can affect the ability to detect an animal.  Furthermore, these results contain data collected over a 30 year period without regard for any long term temporal changes that may have occurred with species or the environment.  Further analysis is necessary to determine if such changes have occurred with any species. While it is possible to separate data collected recently from historical (&gt;20 years old) datasets, the amount of recent data is limited and therefore maps showing only these data may be limited spatially.  Finally, effort calculations do not account for survey width, while normally static during a survey, can be reduced during certain conditions and does vary by survey method, especially boat vs. plan surveys.  The vast majority of survey data collected offshore U.S. Atlantic waters were collected using similar techniques and so effort data will not be greatly affected by such discrepancies. Still, such differences do exist and were not accounted for; therefore, this estimate of survey effort is a rough surrogate for effort.  Consequently, the effort-adjusted counts will also be affected by differences in survey methodology and should be considered only roughly offset by effort.

         <purpose>Currently, the database is based on ~60 datasets from 1906-2009 with over 260,000 records of seabird observations. Summary maps provided as web services (see linkage) include representations of survey effort and bird detections. Effort was standardized into "five minute equivalents" so that both discrete and continuous transect data could be combined. This unit is essentially "five minutes of survey effort from a vessel traveling 10 knots." Species data were prepared for occurrence maps by adjusting counts using these five minute equivalents. The resulting species maps are referred to as "Naive occurrence maps" because, although some effort standardization has been applied, there are no corrections for biases introduced by differences in survey methodology, observers, and species detectability.</purpose>
         <supplinf>
A rough description of the available layers: 
**Web Mapping Services**
1. Survey Effort Total; all years' effort data represented in "five minute equivalent" units. 
2. Survey Effort, Seasonal all years - winter; like the Total Survey Effort, but divided by season 
3. Survey Effort, Decadal all seasons - 2000s; breaks out effort by decade. 
4. Naive Species Effort-adjusted Counts, Seasonal - Audubon’s Shearwater, winter; this is the species data layer. All species codes are listed in this metadata record. Species counts were adjusted using the five-minute equivalent effort units; however due to biases in methods, etc (see elsewhere in this document) these maps combining multiple surveys should be used with caution. 
5. Survey Effort Background, Seasonal - winter; derived from previous layer, but designed to show as background for a species map, showing empty grid cells with effort but no detections. 
6. Focal Species (combined) Effort-adjusted Counts, Seasonal - winter; this is a summary layer essentially "stacking" the naive species occurrence maps for 24 selected species. This list of species is not inclusive of all important species, but was selected as a representative list for discussion purposes for a June 2011 workshop. The species are: (Audubon's Shearwater, Black-capped Petrel, Black Scoter, Common Loon, Common Murre, Cory's Shearwater, Double-crested Cormorant, Dovekie, Great Black-backed Gull, Great Cormorant, Greater Shearwater, Long-tailed Duck, Northern Fulmar, Northern Gannet, Razorbill, Red Phalarope, Red-necked Phalarope, Roseate Tern, Red-throated Loon, Surf Scoter, Unidentified Cormorant, Unidentified Scoter, White-tailed Tropicbird, White-winged Scoter)
**Web Feature Services**
These more flexible services allow for downloading of data and more control over data display, querying, and so on.

      <datacred>This dataset catalog was compiled from dozens of sources primarily by Andrew Gilbert, working for USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center. Many agency, private, and academic partners contributed datasets. This compilation was part of a project to model seabird distribution in the Atlantic offshore area, conducted by Beth Gardner and Allan O'Connell, also at USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center. Initiation of the compilation and support for the analysis were provided by the Minerals Management Service, now Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the US Fish and Wildlife Service.</datacred>

            <procdesc>We retrieved and compiled datasets from a variety of sources including government agencies, academic scientists, non-government organizations, and private individuals.  We received data in a variety of formats and conditions.  Data types and fields varied widely, making it necessary to standardize the data for future modeling needs and GIS analysis and mapping within ESRI ArcGIS (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA).  Normally, we received data in one of several formats: an ESRI Shapefile, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, or ASCII text file.  In a few cases, data were acquired as hand-written notes or printed datasheets which were entered into Microsoft Access databases.  We imported data from these databases into ESRI geodatabase featureclasses for mapping in ArcMap (an ArcGIS mapping utility).  If we received data in any other GIS format, we converted it to the geodatabase feature class.   Currently, seabird survey data are collected using GPS technology and point observations for species are recorded along a continuous survey track.  This information is different from historical survey data that was collected as 10 or 15 minute summaries (transects) for which only the location of the start and sometimes the end of the fixed-time transects were recorded.  We developed computer programs using ArcObjects, the programming environment of ArcGIS, to create track lines from GPS data points, create standardized survey segments, and summarize sampling effort.</procdesc>
