    <descript>
      <abstract>The occurrence of metals, such as lead and copper, in household drinking supplies can often be a result of the corrosion of pipes and joints in water distribution systems. One measure of the potential for water to cause corrosion is the Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) (Langelier, 1936). The LSI is a measure of the potential for water to deposit a mineral layer (scale) within a water distribution system that can inhibit the corrosion of pipes and joints. Negative values of LSI suggest mineral deposition is not likely to occur while positive values indicate conditions favorable to mineral deposition. Negative values of LSI might be indicative of conditions that lead to elevated concentrations of metals, such as lead and cooper, in household water.
The LSI was computed for groundwater samples from 20,962 locations in the United States. The data for the computations of LSI were obtained from the US Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS).  The data included in this report are for groundwater samples obtained during the period 1991-2015. At each location, the most recent sample (during the period 1991-2015) with the necessary measurements was used to compute the LSI. For the purposes of assessment (Langland and Dugas, 1996), LSI values less than -0.5 were classified as potentially corrosive; LSI values between -0.5 and 0.5 were classified as indeterminate; and LSI values greater than 0.5 were classified as scale-forming. Of the 20,962 sites, 31.5% were classified as potentially corrosive, 63 % were classified as indeterminate, and 5.4% as scale-forming. The values of LSI presented in this report can be used to identify which areas in the U.S. might be more susceptible to elevated concentrations of metals, such as lead and copper, in household drinking water and which areas may be less susceptible.</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this report is to provide information that can be used to evaluate one indicator of the potential corrosivity of groundwater sources of the United States.  The Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) is used as an indicator of corrosivity.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The data presented in this report provide a foundation for maps that show statewide characteristic values of LSI for the fifty states and District of Columbia for the United States of America.  The companion report is Belitz and others, 2016.

        <horizpar>A formal accuracy assessment of the horizontal positional information in the data set has not been conducted. However, the accuracy of the well locations vary. Latitude and longitude were extracted from the USGS NWIS system and assumed to be in the North American Datum of 1983. The state that the well is located in was determined from the NWIS database. The state designation is usually recorded by local field crew when the well was initially sampled. However one well, (USGS site number 452411106301601), plotted in Montana but was listed as being it California. It was changed to MT.</horizpar>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Locational and groundwater quality information for 20,962 sites were downloaded from the USGS National Water Information System (Source Input 1). The following water-quality parameter codes were used in the retrieval: 
00095 Specific conductance, water, unfiltered, microsiemens per centimeter at 25 degrees Celsius
90095 Specific conductance, water, unfiltered, laboratory, microsiemens per centimeter at 25 degrees Celsius
00400 pH, water, unfiltered, field, standard units
00403 pH, water, unfiltered, laboratory, standard units 
00915 Calcium, water, filtered, milligrams per liter 
29801 Alkalinity, water, filtered, fixed endpoint (pH 4.5) titration, laboratory, milligrams per liter as calcium carbonate
29802 Alkalinity, water, filtered, Gran titration, field, milligrams per liter as calcium carbonate 
39036 Alkalinity, water, filtered, fixed endpoint (pH4.5) titration, field, milligrams per liter as calcium carbonate.
39086 Alkalinity, water, filtered, incremental titration, field, milligrams per liter as calcium carbonate 
70300 Residue on evaporation, dried at 180 degrees Celsius, water, filtered, milligrams per liter
At each location, the most recent sample (during the period 1991-2015) with the necessary water quality measurements for computing the Langelier Saturation Index (see process step that follows) was retained. In the case where multiple alkalinity values were available for a site, a single value was chosen based upon availability in the following parameter code order: 39086, 39036, 29802, 29801. Data from one location (site ID 443303089211701) was censored due to an anomalously high positive LSI value.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20160205</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) is an approximate measure of the degree of saturation of calcium carbonate in water (Langelier, 1936).  Values of LSI were computed at 25 degrees Celsius as follows:
LSI = pH - pHs
Where:
pH is the measured water pH
pHs is the pH at saturation in calcite or calcium carbonate and is defined as:
pHs = (9.3 + A + B) - (C + D)
Where:
A = (Log10 [TDS] - 1) / 10
B = -13.12 x Log10 (Temp + 273) + 34.55
C = Log10 [Ca x (100.0869/40.078)] - 0.4
D = Log10 [Alk]
And:
TDS = total dissolved solids, in mg/L
Temp = the temperature of the Langelier index in degrees Celsius
Ca = the calcium concentration in mg/L as calcium. 
Alk = the alkalinity concentration in mg/L as calcium carbonate
For some groundwater samples, lab values of pH, alkalinity, and specific conductance were used when field values were not available. In addition, the specific conductance was multiplied by a factor of 0.69 to estimate TDS concentrations when TDS was not measured. Many groundwater sites have been sampled multiple times since January 1, 1991, which result in multiple calculated values of the LSI. Consequently, only the most recent value was used.</procdesc>
