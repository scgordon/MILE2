      <abstract>This 0.5m horizontal resolution digital elevation model, DEM, was developed from Airborne Laser Altimetry flown by Aerometric Inc, now know as Quantum Spatial, Inc. on 12 August, 2012. One Mission was flown and the data jointly processed with LANL personnel to produce a 0.5m DEM covering a region approximately 2.8km wide and 12.5km long extending from the coast above North Salt Lagoon to south of Gas Well Road. This DEM encompasses a diverse range of hyrdrologic, geomorphic, geophysical and biological features typical of the Barrow Penninsula. Vertical accuracy at the 95% confidence interval was computed as 0.145m. The coordinate system, datum, and geoid for this DEM are UTM Zone 4N, NAD83 (2011), NAVD88 (GEOID09). http://dx.doi.org/10.5440/1109234; DOI:10.5440/1109234</abstract>
      <purpose>0.5m LiDAR dataset acquired for an area near Barrow, Alaska on 12 August, 2012.  Data were collected to improved characterization of key landscape elevation features such as polygonal terrain and hydrologic drainage features. This DEM encompasses a diverse range of hyrdrologic, geomorphic, geophysical and biological features typical of the Barrow Peninsula.</purpose>

        <methdesc>LiDAR data acquisition was completed on August 12, 2012. One mission was flown. The LiDAR data for this project was collected with the Aerometric Leica ALS-70 LiDAR system.  All flight planning and acquisition was completed using Leica FPES. Aerometric used the following sensor acquisition settings. The flight altitude (above ground level) was 1195-1197 meters, laser pulse rate was 230.8 kHz, mirror scan frequency was 58 Hz, scan angle (+/-) was 16o,  side lap was 50 %, and ground speed was 160 kts. &amp;#xD;
The LiDAR data for this project was acquired in one mission. Airborne GPS and IMU data was collected during acquisition for use in determining the sensor's position. The mission included the acquisition of all planned project lines and cross flights. The cross flights were flown perpendicular to the planned flight lines and their data used in the in-situ calibration of the sensor. The mission was processed using Leica IPAS-TC software to determine both the airborne GNSS trajectory, and the blending of inertial data. Aerometric operated a GPS base station on location during the acquisition of this data. The position of the base station and raw GPS data were computed by Aerometric for use in processing.&amp;#xD;
The airborne GNSS/IMU post processed data along with the LiDAR raw measurements were processed using Leica IPAS-TC 3.1. This software was used to match the raw LiDAR measurements with the computed positions and attitudes of the LiDAR sensor. The result was a point cloud of LiDAR measured points referenced to the ground control system. One LAS 1.2 file was generated per flightline.</methdesc>

        <procdesc>We used 285 checkpoints acquired by UMIAQ to compute the vertical accuracy. The computed RMSE at the 95th percentile confidence interval was 0.145 meters, meeting the general LiDAR data vertical accuracy specifications. This analysis was carried out by Chandana Gangodagamage at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.</procdesc>
