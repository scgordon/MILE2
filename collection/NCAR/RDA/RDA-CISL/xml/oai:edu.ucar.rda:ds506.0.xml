   <title>U.S. Surface Data Keyed from the Climate Database Modernization Program (CDMP)</title>
   <summary>
      <p>This data set contains U.S. station surface observations
              that were digitized from the original forms by the Climate Database
              Modernization Program (CDMP).</p>
      <p>Data are available for more than 200 stations (mainly at
              airports, but also some city weather bureau offices) that made
              observations at hourly intervals at least during the daytime
              hours and often over the full 24-hour day.  The general period
              of record for these stations is 1928-1948, though this varies
              by individual station.  To find out what is available, see
              <a href="/datasets/ds506.0/inventories/sao_inventory.txt">
              this inventory</a>.  A significant effort was made by DSS to
              correct errors in the digitized data, especially dates, times,
              and pressures.  For more information about this work, see
              <a href="/datasets/ds506.0/docs/qc-20040110.txt">this
              document</a>.</p>
      <p>We have also received data for more than 130 U.S. stations
              that were digitized from Form 1001.  These stations, which were
              usually city weather bureau offices, generally took
              observations once, twice, or four times daily.  Some stations
              have data back as far as late 1892.  An
              <a href="/datasets/ds506.0/inventories/form1001_inventory.txt">
              inventory</a> can be viewed which shows stations and their
              date range coverage.  These data will be made available to the
              community when errors in the digitized data have been corrected.
