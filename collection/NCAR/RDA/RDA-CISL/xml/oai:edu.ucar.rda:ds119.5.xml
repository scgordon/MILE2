   <title>ERA40 Model Resolution Gridded Variances and Covariances on Model Levels from ECMWF</title>
   <summary>
      <p>The ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA40) is a global atmospheric analysis of many
              conventional observations and satellite data streams for the
              period Sept,1957- Aug,2002.  There are numerous data products that are separated
              into dataset series' based on resolution, vertical coordinate
              reference, and likely research applications.  Descriptions of the series
              organization and direct links to information about all ERA40 products
              are <a href="http://rda.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/joey/era40sum.pl?ds=ds118.1">available</a>.</p>
      <p>
              This dataset contains variances and covariances on the original 60 model levels, as well as the variance of the surface pressure.  All Variables are archived on
              the full n80 gaussian grid with a resolution of approximately 125 kilometers.  The variances and covariances are produced with respect to the monthly means for each hour four
              synoptic hours (00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC) and for the diurnal mean.</p>
      <p>The ERA-Interim data from ECMWF is an update to the ERA-40 project.  The ERA-Interim data starts in 1989 and has a higher horizontal resolution (T255, N128 nominally 0.703125 degrees) than the ERA-40 data (T159, N80 nominally  1.125 degrees).  ERA-Interim is based on a more current model than ERA-40 and uses 4-D VAR (as apposed to 3-D VAR in ERA-40).  ECMWF will continue to run the ERA-Interim model in near real time thru at least 2010, and possibly longer.  This data is available in        <a href="http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds627.0/">ds627.0</a>. </p>
