   <title>ERA40 WAVE Model Analysis on a 1.5 Degree Latitude-Longitude from ECMWF</title>
   <summary>
      <p>This dataset contains 23 variables from the ERA40 WAVE model on an equally spaced global 1.5 degree latitude-longitude grid.
              All variables are reported four times per day.</p>
      <p>There has been a problem with the wave analysis since the introduction of ERS data at the start of 1991.
              The size of waves of low magnitude (less than 1 meter) may be too high and the corresponding mean periods too high.
              The problem is largely confined to enclosed or partially enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, Baltic Sea,
              the Gulf of Mexico and the East China Sea.</p>
      <p>The ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA40) is a global atmospheric analysis of many
              conventional observations and satellite data streams for the
              period September 1957 to August 2002.  There are numerous data products that are separated
              into dataset series based on resolution, vertical coordinate
              reference, and likely research applications.  Descriptions of the series
              organization and direct links to information about all ERA40 products
              are <a href="http://rda.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/joey/era40sum.pl?ds=ds118.0">available</a>.
              </p>
      <p>The ERA-Interim data from ECMWF is an update to the ERA-40 project.  The ERA-Interim data starts in 1989 and has a higher horizontal resolution (T255, N128 nominally 0.703125 degrees) than the ERA-40 data (T159, N80 nominally 1.125 degrees).  ERA-Interim is based on a more current model than ERA-40 and uses 4DVAR (as opposed to 3DVAR in ERA-40).  ECMWF will continue to run the ERA-Interim model in near real time through at least 2010, and possibly longer.  This data is available in <a href="http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds627.0/">ds627.0</a>.
