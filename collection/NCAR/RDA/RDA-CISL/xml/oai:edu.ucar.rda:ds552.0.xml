   <title>Flow Rates of World Rivers (excluding former Soviet Union countries)</title>
   <summary>
      <p>Monthly river flow rate data for most of the globe except
          former Soviet Union countries, which can be found in <a href="http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds553.1/">ds553.1</a>.
          This compilation was prepared by Byron Bodo in
          July 2001; it succeeds the February 2001 update.  This is a
          combination of datasets from UNESCO, WMO GRDC, the RIVDIS
          by Vorosmarty (1998), and others.  Changes for this version
          are primarily to documentation, however, there are updates to
          one Thai and two Bolivian gauges plus replacement of some UK
          provisional data; details are given in the documentation.</p>
      <p>Average record length is about 26.7 years.  About 2/3 of the
          records have from 10-100+ years of data.</p>
      <p>The USGS offers the CDROM "Hydro-Climatic Data Network:
          Streamflow Data Set, 1874-1988".  This consists of streamflow
          data measured at 1659 sites throughout the US and its
          territories.  Daily mean, monthly mean, annual mean, minimum and
          maximum values of discharge are given for each water year.
          Stations selected distinguish human influences.</p>
