   <title>Russian River Flow Data by Bodo, Enhanced</title>
   <summary>
      <p>Monthly river flow rates for Russia and former Soviet Union
              countries in ds553.1 are augmented with data from the Russian State
              Hydrological Institute (RSHI) and a few sites from the Global
              Hydroclimatic Data Network (GHCDN) .  This compendium (v1.1
              September 2001) includes 2458 gauges spanning all major river and
              oceanographic basins of the entire former Soviet Union.  Exact
              dates vary by station.  See the <a href="http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds553.2/inventories/">inventories</a>
              for detailed information.  Records are generally long: mean
              length is 36.3 years and 1,724 (70%) gauges have 25 or more years
              of data. 1,373 gauges have data to 1985 and another 909 gauges
              also have some data from 1986-1995.  640 gauges represent
              watersheds of 10,000 or more square kilometers, and 1,055 gauges represent
              catchments of 1,000-9,999 square kilometers.  The RSHI additions have not
              been scrutinized as rigorously as ds553.1.</p>
