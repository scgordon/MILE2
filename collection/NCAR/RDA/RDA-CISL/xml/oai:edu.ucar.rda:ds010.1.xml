   <title>Monthly Northern Hemisphere Sea-Level Pressure Grids, continuing from 1899</title>
   <summary>
      <p>This dataset contains the longest continuous time series of
              monthly gridded Northern Hemisphere sea-level pressure data in
              the DSS archive.  The 5-degree latitude/longitude grids,
              computed from the daily grids in
              <a href="http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds010.0/">ds010.0</a>,
              begin in 1899 and cover the Northern Hemisphere from 15N to the
              North Pole.  The dataset continues to be updated regularly as
              new data become available.</p>
      <p>Each monthly grid is a simple average of all available daily
              grids for the month.  Prior to 1955, there is one grid per day.
              From July 1962 on, there are two grids each day.  In the interim
              period, the number of daily grids varies between one and
              two.</p>
      <p>The grids for the period 1899-1977 were inspected and many
              corrections were made by Kevin Trenberth of the Laboratory of
              Atmospheric Research at the University of Illinois at
              Champaign-Urbana, and these grids are included in this dataset.
              For more information about these corrections, see the July 1980
              issue of <i>Monthly Weather Review</i>.</p>
