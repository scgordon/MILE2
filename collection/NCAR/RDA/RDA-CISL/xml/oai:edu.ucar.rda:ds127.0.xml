   <title>ERA40 T106 6-hourly Surface Analysis and Surface Forecast Fields, created at NCAR</title>
   <summary>
      <p>DS127.0 represents a dataset implemented and computed by NCAR's Data Support Section, and forms an essential
              part of efforts undertaken in late 2004, early 2005, to produce an archive of selected segments of ERA-40 on
              standard transformation grids.</p>
      <p>
              In this case, forty six ERA-40 6-hourly surface and single level analysis
              variables were transformed from a reduced N80 Gaussian grid to a 320 by 160 regular Gaussian grid. All fields were
              transformed using routines from the ECMWF EMOS library, including 10 meter winds which were treated as scalars
              because of a lack of 10 meter spectral vorticity and divergence. A missing value occurs in the sea
              surface temperature and sea ice fields to mask grid points occurring over land. Fields formerly
              archived as whole integers, such as vegetation indices and cloud cover, occur as integers plus a fractional part
              in the T106 version due to interpolation.</p>
      <p>
              In addition, twenty seven ERA-40 6-hourly surface and single level 6-hour forecast
              variables were transformed from a reduced N80 Gaussian grid to a 320 by 160 regular Gaussian grid.
              (These are designated as OTHER, or other, variables below.)
              All variables are valid 6 hours after the forecast was initiated. Thus, 00Z 6-hour forecast evaporation
              is valid at 06Z. Four of the variables are instantaneous variables, and the remaining twenty three variables
              are accumulated over the 6-hour forecast time. Divide the accumulated variables by 21600 seconds to obtain
              instantaneous values. (Multiplication by minus one may also be necessary to match the sign convention one is
              accustomed to.)  All fields were transformed using routines from the ECMWF EMOS library, including three
              pairs of stresses which were treated as scalars because of a lack of spectral precursors.</p>
      <p>The ERA-Interim data from ECMWF is an update to the ERA-40 project.  The ERA-Interim data starts in 1989 and has a higher horizontal resolution (T255, N128 nominally 0.703125 degrees) than the ERA-40 data (T159, N80 nominally  1.125 degrees).  ERA-Interim is based on a more current model than ERA-40 and uses 4DVAR (as opposed to 3DVAR in ERA-40).  ECMWF will continue to run the ERA-Interim model in near real time through at least 2010, and possibly longer.
