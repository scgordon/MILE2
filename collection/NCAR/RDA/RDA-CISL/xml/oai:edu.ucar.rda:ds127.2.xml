   <title>ERA40 T106 Analysis Fields on Model Levels, created at NCAR</title>
   <summary>
      <p>DS127.2 represents a dataset implemented and computed by NCAR's Data Support Section, and forms an essential
              part of efforts undertaken in late 2004, early 2005, to produce an archive of selected segments of ERA-40 on
              standard transformation grids. In this case, ERA-40 6-hourly upper air variables on 60 model levels were transformed
              from either spherical harmonics (surface geopotential, temperature, vertical velocity, vorticity, logarithm of surface
              pressure, divergence), or a reduced N80 Gaussian grid (specific humidity, ozone mass mixing ratio, cloud liquid water
              content, cloud ice water content, cloud cover), to a 320 by 160 regular Gaussian grid at T106 spectral truncation. In addition,
              horizontal wind components were derived from spectral vorticity and divergence and also archived on a T106 Gaussian
              grid. All scalar fields were transformed using routines from the ECMWF EMOS library, whereas the horizontal winds were
              obtained using NCAR's SPHEREPACK library.</p>
      <p>The ERA-Interim data from ECMWF is an update to the ERA-40 project.  The ERA-Interim data starts in 1989 and has a higher horizontal resolution (T255, N128 nominally 0.703125 degrees) than the ERA-40 data (T159, N80 nominally  1.125 degrees).  ERA-Interim is based on a more current model than ERA-40 and uses 4DVAR (as opposed to 3DVAR in ERA-40).  ECMWF will continue to run the ERA-Interim model in near real time through at least 2010, and possibly longer.  This data is available in <a href="http://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds627.0/">ds627.0</a>. </p>
