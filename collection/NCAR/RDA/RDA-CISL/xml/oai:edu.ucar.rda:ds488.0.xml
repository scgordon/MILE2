   <title>NSIDC Daily Precipitation Totals at Coastal and Island Russian Arctic Stations, 1940-1990</title>
   <summary>
      <p>"This data set contains precipitation data originally recorded in log
              books at 65 coastal and island meteorological stations, and later
              digitized at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI), St.
              Petersburg, Russia, under the direction of Vladimir Radionov.  Records
              from most stations begin in 1940.  Instrumentation was generally a rain
              gauge with Nipher shield until the early 1950s (for most stations), when
              the Tretyakov precipitation gauge replaced earlier instrumentation.  Data
              have not been adjusted for gauge type or wind bias.  Data from 1967 and
              later are corrected for wetting loss (this correction was made by
              observers as they recorded the station data).", quoted summary from NSIDC documentation.</p>
      <p>The data files and associated documentation were downloaded from NSIDC to this DSS
              dataset in January 2007. See the
