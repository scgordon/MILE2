   <title>India Precipitation, weekly 1979-1985</title>
   <summary>
      <p>India weekly precipitation, 1979 through 1985, for 34 mainland
              divisions and an island, have been digitized by Eric Smith,
              Florida State University, from India's "Weekly Weather Report",
              provided by D. Sikka.  This is based on the stations that report
              operationally (probably 500-1000 stations).  More stations are
              available in delayed time.  The division precipitation for a
              week is the average of stations that did report during that
              week.  The weeks are continuous.  The division normals for the
              period 1901-1970 are included in the data.</p>
