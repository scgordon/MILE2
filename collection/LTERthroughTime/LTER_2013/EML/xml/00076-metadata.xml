    <abstract>
      <para>The Southeast Environmental Research Center at Florida International University operates a network of 331 fixed sampling sites distributed throughout the estuarine and coastal ecosystems of south Florida. The purpose of this network is to address concerns in regional water quality which cross and overlap separate political boundaries. Funding has come from different sources with individual programs being added as funding became available. Biscayne Bay, Florida Bay, Whitewater Bay, Ten Thousand Islands, Rookery Bay, Estero Bay, andPine Island Sound are sampled monthly while the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) and the southwest shelf are sampled quarterly. Variables currently being measured include surface and bottom temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, total nitrogen, total organic nitrogen, total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, total organic carbon, total silicate, chlorophyll a, alkaline phosphatase activity, turbidity, and light extinction. The purpose of this network is to address concerns in regional water quality which cross and overlap separate political boundaries. One of the products is a quasi-synoptic big picture of nutrient and phytoplankton biomass distributions over the South Florida Coastal Waters. The SERC network will, in time, provide us with the data necessary to determine whether conditions within the estuaries and sanctuary are improving or declining.</para>

          <para>Water samples were collected and analyzed by SERC personnel using standardmethodology outlined in the Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) with prior approval from SFWMD and FDEP. Salinity and temperature (degrees C) were measured 10 cm below the surface and 10 cm above the bottom using a combination salinity-conductivity-temperature probe (Orion model 140). Surface and bottom dissolved oxygen (DO, mg l-1) was measured using an oxygen electrode (Orion model 840), corrected for both salinity and temperature. Duplicate, unfiltered water samples were collected from 10 cm below the surface using sample rinsed, 120 ml HDPE bottles and kept at ambient temperature in the dark during transport. Duplicate water samples for dissolved nutrient analysis were collected using sample rinsed 150 ml syringes. These samples were filtered by hand (25 mm glass fiber GF/F) into acetone-washed and sample rinsed 60 ml HDPE bottles, which were then capped and immediately placed on ice in the dark for transport. The wet filters, used for chlorophyll a analysis (CHLA), were placed in 2 ml plastic centrifuge tubes to which 1.5 ml of 90% acetone was added. They were then immediately capped and put into a dark bottle on ice for transport. Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH&lt;2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples. TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. The APA assay measures the activity of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme used by bacteria to mineralize phosphate from organic compounds. The assay is performed by adding a knownconcentration of an organic phosphate compound (o-methylfluorescein phosphate) to an unfiltered water sample. Alkaline phosphatase in the water sample cleaves the phosphate, leaving o-methylfluorescein, a highly fluorescent compound. The fluorescence of initial and 2 hr incubations were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV spectrofluorometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm) and subtracted to give APA (uM h-1). Turbidity was measured using an HF Scientific model DRT-15C turbidimeter and reported in NTU. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOx), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). Filters for CHLA content (&#181;g l-1) were allowed to extract for a minimum of 2 days at -20degrees C before analysis. Extracts were analyzed using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrofluorometer (excitation = 435 nm, emission = 667 nm) and compared to a standard curve of pure CHLA (Sigma). Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in units of milligrams per liter (mg l-1) or the equivalent parts per million (ppm), except where noted. All nutrient concentrations are based on the atomic weight of primary nutrient species (ppm-N, ppm-P, and ppm-C), not the molecular weight. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis.</para>

        <abstract>
          <para>We are investigating how variability in regional climate, freshwater inputs, disturbance, and perturbations affect the coastal Everglades ecosystem. Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses:  Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.</para>

          <abstract>
            <para>Our FCE I research focused on understanding how dissolved organic matter from upstream oligotrophic marshes interacts with a marine source of phosphorus (P), the limiting nutrient, to control estuarine productivity where these two influences meet-in the oligohaline ecotone. This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these "upside-down" estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is:  In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.  Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

            <abstract>
              <para>Coastal ecosystems are being modified at unprecedented rates through interacting
pressures of global climate change and rapid human population growth, impacting natural coastal
resources and the services they provide. Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence
freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences,
coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual &#8220;upside-down&#8221; productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

        <notes>These long-term water quality monitoring data are collected by Henry Briceno with the Southeast Environmental Research Center at FIU.  Although some of these data were not collected using FCE LTER funding, the data are collected at or near the FCE LTER Research sites.  These data are invaluable and are an important addition to the long-term water quality monitoring efforts being conducted by the FCE LTER.  These data replace original LT_ND_Boyer_001 and all subsequent version prior to April 2013.                                                                                                 </notes>
