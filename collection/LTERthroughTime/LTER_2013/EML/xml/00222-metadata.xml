Plot location was chosen based on dominate vegetation type (T or W).  The tussock tundra plots are located near the Moist Acidic Tundra plots characterized by Shaver and Chapin (1991).  The wet sedge plots are located near the outlet of Toolik Lake;  all plots have been used by the Arctic LTER project at Toolik Lake.

In wet sedge tundra, three 1 m2-sized plots were positioned randomly in each of two treatments of block 2 of the LTER wet sedge scheme (outlet site), control and N+P-fertilized , respectively, in 2000. Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N at one of three different dates of the summer season 2001.

In moist acidic tussock tundra six 1 m2 sized plots were positioned in three of the "X" (=extra") blocks of the LTER scheme, in 2001, inside an area extending 5 m from the boardwalks and, positioning plots so that similar area shares between tussocks and intertussock areas was achieved. In each of the three X blocks two 1m2-sized plots were established. The whole 5 m area of the X blocks extending from the board walks was divided into two halfs, each containing one of the 1m2 sized plots. One half was set aside as the control and the other half was designated to be fertilized. Fertilization with a Hoagland solution (see protocol) started in late summer 2001, and was repeated annually after that , early in the summer season.  Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N  of the summer season 2002; all three pairs were labelled as closely together in time as logistically possible.

Using soil needles and syringes, we pulled soil water for dissolved nutrient analyses.  The Water was filtered using a Whatman GF/F filter (0.7&#181;m pore size, nominal) into polypropelyne bottles (SRP and NH4) or glass scint vials (DOC).  Samples were stored at 4 degreeC in the dark until analysis.  SRP and NH4 were analyzed usually within 24hrs of sampling. DOC samples were acidified to pH ~3 after filtration and sent to the University of Michigan for analysis.
  
1.  SRP:
Soluble reactive phosphorus was analyzed using a molybdate colorometric assay (Wetzel and Likens, 1979).  Each sample, standard, and blank was duplicated during analysis.  We pipetted 10 mLs of each into two P tubes. After the 1 mL SRP reagent was added the samples were incubated in the tlight for 30-90 minutes.  The samples were analyzed on the spectrophotometer in the dry lab.  All waste was dumped into radactive waste container.
   
2.  NH4:
Ammonium ion concentrations were analyzed using a fluorometric assay modified to correct the calculation errors in the original publication.  Details of methods, reagents, etc are given in Holmes et al. 1999.  The method relies on the the reagent Orthophthadialdehyde (OPA) to bind witht he ammonium causing fluorescence.  Each sample under went four treatments: 1. Background Fluorescence (BF), sample + color blank, 2. Sample + Working Reagent, 3. Sample + Working Reagent + Low Spike Addition, and 4. Sample + Working Reagent + Low Spike Addition.  The samples were incubated in the dark for at least 8 hours.  All treatments were measured on the flourometer in the wet lab.  Background fluorescence was subtracted from treatments 2,3,and 4.  The concentration of ammonium was calculated using a standard addition curve to account for Matrix Effects (APHA, 1995).  All waste was dumped into radactive waste container.

3.  DOC:
Samples were run on a Shimadzu TOC 5000 Carbon Analyzer using a platinum catalyzed high-temperature combustion to CO2 and infrared detection (Shimadzu TOC-5000; Shimadzu, Columbia, MD).

The goal of Arctic LTER project is to predict the future ecological characteristics of the site based upon our knowledge of the controls of ecosystem structure and function as exerted by physical setting and geologic factors, climatic factors, biotic factors, and the changes in fluxes of water and materials from land to water. To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches:

Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. 

Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. 

Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

          <geographicCoverage>
            <geographicDescription>The Arctic LTER research site (68&#176;N and 149&#176;W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities.</geographicDescription>
