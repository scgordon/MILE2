      <para>This datalayer is part of a group of layers used for research in the Ipswich River Watershed. This layer was created in July 2006 for 
        Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole. This layer shows the land use for the towns in the Ipswich River Watershed and the Parker 
        River Watershed for 1991. This datalayer has complete information. Provide land use information for general mapping and display, and landuse

             In ArcMap, towns within our study area were selected from LANDUSE and a new layer was created from this selection. Towns were selected by attribute, based on their Town_ID code. The following Town_IDs were 
             selected: 9, 30, 31, 38, 48, 71, 92, 105, 116, 119, 144, 164, 184, 205, 206, 210, 213, 229, 246, 254, 295, 320, 298, 324, 342, and 347. The selected features were then exported as a new layer, TOWNSFROMLU.

            The land use map of the study area was imported into Idrisi Kiliminjaro and converted to a raster file. After importing TOWNSFROMLU, the data base file was opened and the field LU21_1991 was exported to a raster image.

            The map was updated to give a value of 3 to pixels in the following positions: (r: 344. c: 1017) and (r: 769, c: 1179). This value was assigned because these pixels were not classified in the conversion from vector to raster. They were assigned membership to the foreset class based on visual analysis of the original vector data.

  		<abstract>
  			<para>
  				The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER is an integrated research, education and outreach program whose goal is to develop a predictive 
  				understanding of the long-term response of watershed and estuarine ecosystems at the land-sea interface to changes in climate, land use 
  				and sea level. The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the 
  				adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic 
  				nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external 
  				drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the 
  				spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.

  				<geographicCoverage>
  					<geographicDescription>The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, 
  						formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich 
  						(404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston "bedroom" communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a 
  						higher proportion of forest.
