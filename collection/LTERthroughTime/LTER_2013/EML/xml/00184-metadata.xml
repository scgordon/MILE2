      <title>Data Policies</title>

        <literalLayout>Objectives:
The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html).

Disclaimer:
While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available "as is". The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets.

Quality Assurance Policy:
Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of "metadata" documentation.
In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers.

Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data:
Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin.
Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted.

Data Access Policy:
Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research.

Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives:
Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

Data Acknowledgment Policy:
Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use.
Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned:
Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Funding for these data was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210).

            <literalLayout>An Aerochem metrics WET/DRY Precipitation collector holds both a WET and a DRY precipitation collector bucket (11" top diameter). The bucket is replaced in the field with a clean bucket whenever one is brought back from the field for processing. The DRY is collected once a month. The WET is collected after each collectable rain event.  Preliminary sample preparation is done in Rm 236 as per written procedure. Samples are then sent to Dr. W.H. Schlesinger at Duke University for analysis. Results sent back have had values adjusted for any dilutions done when preparing the samples for analysis. Blank values have also been subtracted out.

Preparation of WETFALL/DRYFALL PRECIPITATION samples for analysis: (FILE: WETDRY.PRO) 
UPDATED: 6/8/88 as per conversation with Bill Schlesinger.

Cleaning:  All materials that come in contact with sample are
         cleaned as follows:
         1. Rinse thoroughly with tap water.
         2. Wash with dilute solution of Alconox detergent.
         3. Rinse minimum 3 times thoroughly with deionized water.
         4. Rinse minimum 3 times thoroughly with solution of 1N HCl.
         5. Rinse minimum 5 times thoroughly with deionized water.
         6. Do not touch any surfaces that will be in contact with
            sample.
         7. Place materials in drain to dry in such a position that
            surfaces to be in contact with sample will not be
            contaminated by drain or by particulate fallout.  Do not
            leave collector buckets overnight.
         8. Filter apparatus, bottles, etc. used to process sample
            are to be rinsed 3 times with deionized water immediately
            prior to using when they are clean.  Otherwise, clean as
            per steps 1-7 above immediately before using.

For WETFALL sample only:
          Add up to 100ml to one pre-weighed 125ml bottle of
             WETFALL sample.
          Add approximately 1 microliter of PMA (phenylmercuric
             acetate) for each milliliter of sample.
          Weigh 125ml bottle with sample.  Subtract bottle weight from
             total  weight  and calculate amount of  WETFALL  assuming
             1g=1ml  water.   If more WETFALL  remains  in  collection
             bucket,  weigh  remaining  bucket  sample,  obtain  total
             WETFALL volume, and record in WET/DRY PRECIPITATION  data
             book.

Each  bottle  is  labeled  with  type  of  analysis  to   be performed,  type  of precipitation (wet or dry),  and  collection date.   We  try to provide subsamples of 100ml for each  type  of analysis.  Samples are refrigerated until just prior to shipping.

Analysis:
In each sample, F, Cl, NO3, SO4, NH4, Ca, Mg, Na, K, total N, and total P are determined by standard laboratory procedures: F, Cl, NO3, SO4 by ion chromatography, NH4 by autoanalyzer: Ca, Mg, Na, by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, total N and total P by persulfate digestion (D'Elia et al. 1977, Limnology and Oceanography 22:760-764) and by autoanalyzer. 

Dissolved Organic Nitrogen (DON) is determined by subtracting inorganic nitrogen (NO3-N and NH4-N) from Total Nitrogen (TN) as determined using the D'Elia persulfate digestion and autoanalyzer.</literalLayout>

        <literalLayout>The Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research program, in collaboration with 
                         the USDA ARS Jornada Experimental Range, studies the causes and consequences of 
                         desertification: the broad scale expansion of woody plants into grasslands that 
                         results in more "desert like" conditions. We are interested in spatial and 
                         temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the 
                         geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental 
                         drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the 
                         vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across 
                         scales.
                        
                         Our study site is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, approximately 25 km 
                         northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA (+32.5 N, -106.8 W, elevation 1188 m). 
                         Annual precipitation is 24 cm and maximum temperatures average 13 C in January 
                         and 36 C in June. Our study site includes the 78,000 ha Jornada Experimental 
                         Range operated by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and the 22,000 ha 
                         Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) operated by New Mexico State 
                         University. The Jornada Basin LTER project was established in 1982, and is 
                         administered by New Mexico State University. This site is a member of the LTER 
                         Network, one of  more than 25 long term sites funded by the U.S. National Science
