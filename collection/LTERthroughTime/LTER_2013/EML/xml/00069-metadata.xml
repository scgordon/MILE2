    <abstract>
      <para>This file contains the consolidated data for percent cover of dominant bryophytes and other easilty idenfiable macro-algae in the experimental reaches of the Kuparuk River beginning in 1993 and updated annually. In some years percent cover was recorded more than one time per seaon. In all years percent cover was recorded in riffle habitats and in some (early) years percent cover was recorded for pool habitats. Moss point transects have been done on the Kuparuk since 1993.</para>

Study Site
General description (modified from Benstead et al. 2007): Fertilization of the Kuparuk River with P (added as H3PO4 via continuous dripper from mid-June to mid-August, fixed-rate with a target concentration of 0.3 &#181;M at a nominal discharge of 2 m3/sec) started in the summer of 1983. The H3PO4 was added at an arbitrary point called 0.0 km, located 1.6 km upstream of the river crossing at the Dalton Highway (see Peterson et al., 1985 for early results of fertilization). In subsequent years, all points on the Kuparuk River were referenced relative to this datum. In 1985 the P dripper was moved 0.59 km downstream, forming the first Kuparukrecovery reach (enriched for the two previous summers, 1983-1984) between 0.0 km and 0.59 km. In 1996 the dripper was moved downstream a second time, to 1.4 km below the original dripper site. The reach between 0.59 km and 1.4 km became the second Kuparuk recovery reach (enriched for 13 consecutive summers, 1983-1995).  See Slavik et al. (2004) for an summary of other relevant data the Kuparuk River long-term fertilization experiment.
The specific reaches represented in this data set come from the following general areas unless noted otherwise:   
1992-1995
Fertilized from  0.59km to 18km
Reference from 0.5km to -9.5km
1996-2010
Fertilized from 1.6km to 6km
Recovery from 1km to 1.39km
Reference from -0.47 to 0.7km
2011-Present
Fertilized from 1.6km to 6km
Re-Fert 2 from 0.7km to 1.39km
Re-Fert 1 from 0km to 0.6km
Reference from -0.47 to -0.1km
Sampling Methods
Data were acquired using point transects (Bowden et al. 1994, Bowden et al. 2006).  Typically five transects were established across the river at ever sampling station.  The transect locations were not permanently monumented and so for sites that were revisited several times a year or over many years, the exact location of the transects vary somewhat.  While useful information is contained in the individual transects, statistical comparisons should typically be based on the mean cover values for all transects done at a site as the fundamental reporting unit.  At intervals of about 10 cm along each transect, we noted the nature of the plant cover on the cobbles.  Three moss species (Schistidium [Grimmia] agassizii Sull. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Lesq. in Sull., a mixture of H. alpestre [Hedw.] Loeske and H. ochraceum [Turn.] Loeske, and Fontinalis neomexicana Sull. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Lesq.), one liverwort (Solenostoma sp.), and the macroalgae previously mentioned, could be identified easily by eye in the field and were recorded as being present or absent.  In subsequent years, other easily recognizable cover categories were recorded (e.g. Lemanea spp., Phormidium spp.).  Only one species was assigned to a point.  For a typical river width of 15 m, each transect provided roughly 150 points or 750 points at each station.  Species frequency was determined from the number of times each species was encountered, divided by the total number of points sampled in a transect.  Only one species (or "bare") was recorded as present at any one point.  &#8220;Bare&#8221; recordings in the field notes were assumed to consist of an epilithic biofilm of diatoms and other microalgae as reported by Miller et al. (1992) and are recorded in the database here as "Epilithic algae".  
In different years slightly different river sites were sometimes measured.  Any measured site is a representative sample of the reach from which it came.  The dataset contains the "actual" station location information.  However, to consolidate the data and facilitate comparisons among reaches and across years, the data from closely co-located actual stations has been aggregated

The goal of Arctic LTER project is to predict the future ecological characteristics of the site based upon our knowledge of the controls of ecosystem structure and function as exerted by physical setting and geologic factors, climatic factors, biotic factors, and the changes in fluxes of water and materials from land to water. To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches:

Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. 

Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. 

Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

            <geographicDescription>The Arctic LTER research site (68&#176;N and 149&#176;W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities.</geographicDescription>
