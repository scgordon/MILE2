North Inlet-Winyah Bay features high quality, ocean-dominated waters and salt marshes in North Inlet, contrasting with the brackish waters and marshes of Winyah Bay. The bay estuary is dominated by riverine discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural, municipal and industrial development. Former rice fields  and canals provide another system for study within the Reserve. The Debidue site is located at the confluence of Town Creek and Debidue Creek. The Bread and Butter site is located along the western shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of Clambank Creek.   
     Site Location

     The North Inlet LTER is located on the eastern coast of the Atlantic
     Ocean in a small tidal estuary (area = 2630 hectares) near Georgetown, 
     South Carolina, USA.  Coordinates for the North Inlet estuary are 
     longitude 79 degrees 10 minutes and latitude 33 degrees 21 minutes.   
     Motile epibenthic sled collections were made from one or two locations
     along Town Creek, towing with the path of the ebbing tidal current. 
     The DD (Debidue) site is located at the confluence of Town Creek and
     Debidue Creek.  The 100 m tow path followed a transect beginning at a
     fixed point on Debidue Island and followed the shoreline due south
     (approx. 5 m from shore) in line with a large heavily vegetated dune
     on North Island.  The tow path terminated on a line with the boilers
     of a sunken ship and the tip of Debidue Island (looking to the NE). 
     Each tow lasted approx. 5 minutes depending on tidal velocity.

     The BB (Bread and Butter) site is located along the western
     shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of Clambank Creek.  
     Each of three sequential tows began at a small (1 m wide) drainage
     creek about 50m south of Clambank Creek confluence.  The tow was
     started about 5 m from the edge of the marsh and ended about 30 m from
     the edge of the marsh.


     The tow path extended to a line between the Clambank tower and the
     first small drainage southwest of Boze's Creek mouth.  Each tow lasted
     approx. 5 min. depending upon tidal velocity.  For further
     information, consult the maps of sample locations on file.

     Site Character

     The DD (Debidue) site near Town Creek mouth and North Inlet, is 
     characterized by a high energy sandy bottom with regular ridges and 
     swales.  Depth along the tow path averages 3-4 m at sampling time. 
     The tidal amplitude of .5 m is typical.  The bottom is sand with
     little or no hard substrate (shell, rock).  Seasonal growths of
     bryozoan and algae occur.  Generally, little or no organic matter is
     collected in the epibenthic sled.

     The BB (Bread and Butter) site is located along Town Creek 
     approximately 2 km from the inlet mouth.  At this location the creek
     is bounded by extensive Spartina alterniflora marshes.  The inter tidal
     zone is covered by clusters of the American oyster (Crassostrea
     virginica), shell rubble and intermittent muddy flats.  The bottom
     supports seasonal growths of sponges, algae, hydroids, bryozoans, and
     soft corals as well as oysters.  Much of the bottom habitat is sandy
     mud covered by varying accumulations of detrital plant and fecal
     material.  Depth along the tow path ranges from 2-4 m at sampling.

     Town Creek is a high salinity creek dominated by semi-diurnal tides.

     Rain input, primarily runoff, depresses salinities briefly (hours -
     days) depending on duration and frequency.  Water temperatures mirror
     local air conditions:  warm temperate.  See Temperature and Salinity

     A series of three sequential tows were made at each of 2 stations at 
     two week intervals 2 1/2 hours prior to low tide.  All collections
     were made during the late morning (9 - 11 am) hours.  An epibenthic
     sled (see description) was towed behind an outboard boat motoring
     approximately 2 knots faster than the ebbing tidal current.  All tows
     were made moving with the tidal flow along a marked tow path 100 m in
     length.  Tows usually lasted approx. 5 minutes depending upon tidal
     velocity.  Volume of water filtered was estimated with a torpedo
     shaped General Oceanics flow meter model 2040 mounted in the mouth of
     the net.  Flow meter readings are recorded before and after each tow.

     Upon sample retrieval, the contents of the net were concentrated in
     the removable cod end and transferred into pre-labeled Nalgene jars and
     100percent buffered formalin stained with Rose Bengal added to bring the
     final concentration to 5 - 10percent formalin.  In the event of a large
     catch of sponge, algae, shell, or an oversized organism (greater than
     or equal to 1 liter volume), the sample was poured into a bucket and
     the excess material rinsed, noted, and discarded.  The remaining
     sample was then sieved through a fine mesh net (less than or equal to
     365 micron), placed in a pre-labeled jar, and preserved.  Samples were
     returned to the lab for analysis.

     Gear Description

     Epibenthic Sled:  The apparatus consists of a rectangular steel
     frame (51 X 30 cm) mounted on 3 skis which orient the mouth of a #2
     (365 micron) Nitex, 1/2 m mouth diameter standard conical plankton net
     perpendicular to the creek bottom.  The apparatus does not dig into
     the sediment, but does collect soft-bodied sessile invertebrates
     (sponges, bryozoans, etc.) in addition to small motile organisms
     within 30 cm of the bottom.  A 12m tow rope tied to the leading point
     of the sled chassis allowed for the best contact between the skis and
     the bottom along most of the tow paths.

     Lab Analysis

     Prior to counting, the sample is sieved, rinsed with fresh water and
     the used formalin disposed.  The rinsed sample is then placed in a
     graduated beaker and sample volume recorded.  In the event the volume
     of settled material is excessive (greater than or equal to 100 ml) the
     sample is divided with a cylindrical splitting apparatus until a
     workable fraction is obtained (never less than 12.5percent of original
     volume).

     Sorting is done under a binocular dissecting microscope at 60 -
     120X. All organisms of appropriate size (greater than or equal to 365
     micron) are enumerated. (See Epibenthos Sample Information sheet and
     "Epibenthos Full Screen Management Program" for a listing of common
     taxa and all taxa encountered , respectively.)

     During the first year (1/20/81-1/9/82), 100 of each species of
     mysids; decapod larvae, juveniles, and adults; cumaceans; stomatopods;
     isopods; fish eggs, larvae, and juveniles (up to 100 per species per
     replicate) and rare organisms were isolated.  All isolated specimens
     were stored by appropriate taxon in labeled flint vials and preserved
     in 10percent formalin buffered and stained with Rose Bengal.  Vials were
     stored by station and cruise for future analysis and reference.

     From 1/21/84 - 1/4/85, up to 100 of each species of fish larvae were
     isolated from each station.  The first 100 encountered in replicates
     A, B, or C were in label vials and stored until length measurements
     were made.   Larvae were measured using vernier calipers for larger
     specimens (greater than or = 10mm) or an ocular micrometer for small specimens (less than
     or = 10mm).  Lengths were recorded to the nearest .1mm with the
     ocular micrometer.

     Following sorting and enumeration the counted sample was recombinedwith the unsorted portion, placed in a labeled 500 ml flint jar,
     preserved with a fresh, buffered and stained 10percent formalin solution and
     stored for future reference.

     Counts

     Counting sheets underwent three revisions as we become more familiar
     with the taxa and their relative abundance/importance over time. 
     Copies of counting sheets used during different periods are in this
     documentation.  The original sheet was used through cruise no. 99 the
     end of the first 4 years.  Notes on taxonomy and life history were
     written on these sheets for the record.  A simplified sheet with fewer
     categories and no entry slots for life history stages/sex was used for
     cruises 100-145 to speed up processing tissue.  When analysis of data
     showed that much was lost in lumping genera and species into more
     general categories, and when time became available, reprocessing of
     those samples was done to upgrade the data base.  See item 25 for
     details.  The final counting sheet (145-present) was consistent with
     the IBM full screen manager.  It includes sub-categories which provided
     resolution on the broader categories in the upper portion of the
     sheet.  All data on the counting sheets is actual raw count data based on
     whatever portion of the sample was processed.

     Total numbers of organisms per sample were calculated using the
     following equations (see below), and were entered in the Motile
     Epibenthos Full Screen Manager.  Calculating the water filtered
     (estimated by flow meter readings) were calculated for subsequent
     calculations of organism concentrations (See Equation 2).

     Equation 1:  Total Organisms       n = raw count
                                        MF = Multiplication
                                             Factor for sub-sampling
                                        T = total organisms per sample

           n X MF = T


     Equation 2:  Water Volume        RPT = flow meter
                                            revolutions per tow
                                      RPM = flow meter
                                            calibration
                                      A(m2) = Area of net mouth
                                              (0.13 m2)
 
          RPT/RPM x A(m2)= V(m3)

     Other Data

     1)  From 1/20/81 - 1/9/82, length measurements (carapace and telson)
     were made of the isolated adult and juvenile caridean shrimps.  Data
     were stored by species and computer statistical analyses (length
     regressions, means, etc.) performed.  This information is on file.

     2)  Four years (1/20/81 - 1/4/85) of larval and juvenile fish
     lengths were recorded and stored by species and year in a separate
     data file and screen.

     3)  Decapod shrimp life history and developmental staging
     information was recorded on data sheets, on file by cruise/date and
     stored in a separate computer date file.  These data were entered as
     numbers per sample.

     4)  Physical information taken after zpk sampling and before
     epibenthos sampling have been placed into a separate data file named:
     fauna.physical and is merged with the epi fauna counts.  This file 
     contains the variables:

     Cruise#
     month
     day
     year
     time of first sled
     bottom temperature
     bottom salinity
     water depth (taken from zpk marked lines which are attached to nets)
     surface water temperature
     surface salinity
     -50 cm water velocity
     -150 cm " "
     1 above bottom water velocity
     bottom water velocity
     air/range
     air/reading
     -50 cm/range
     -50 cm/reading
     -150 cm/range
     -150 cm reading
     1 above bottom/range
     1 above bottom/reading
     bottom/range
     bottom/reading
   
     Bottom salinity and temperature was not taken until cruise #41 (8-31-
     82).  Water velocity and light readings did not begin untilcruise #100 (1-18-85).  Water depth was not consistently taken until
     cruise #16 (8-26-81)

     The light readings were converted to a single value of Watts/m2.  To
     do this, the range is multiplied by the reading which is then
     multiplied by 0.1.   e.g. Air range x air reading x 0.1 = value in
     Watts/m2</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Experimental Design</title><para><literalLayout>Since previous field studies indicated that stage of tide and time

     was necessary to make collections about every 14 days when the same
     tide stage occurs at the same time of day to keep these 
     variables "constant".  Thus, three sequential tows were made with the 
     same apparatus along the same tow path when the end of the ebbing tide
     occurred near noon.  Replicated biweekly measurements were made to
     allow for statistical comparisons of means among dates.  Comparisons
     of abundance between years provided information on long term trends. 
     Collections at a sandy inlet and a major marsh creek location allowed 
     for a comparison of two habitat types.  The same gear, field
