<abstract>
<section>
<para>A short-term soil manipulation experiment has been conducted as part
of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project.  The response of
soil organisms (nematodes, rotifers and tardigrades) to the treatments is monitored by
sampling soil following various treatment applications. Samples were taken on November 13, 1995, November 17, 1995, November 24, 1995 and December 11, 1995.

                    <literalLayout>This file was created by Mark St. John at Colorado State University on 11 Nov 1998, using raw data from the Excel workbook '9511stca.raw'. The file format was suggested by the LTER data manager, to conform with the relational database structure. On 4 Dec 1998, the file was submitted to Denise Steigerwald, the MCM LTER data manager, located at INSTAAR, University of Colorado.
                        
                        Upon arrival at INSTAAR, the data manager removed columns for latitude and longitude, and updated the location names to match those provided in the "soil measurement locations" file (from which latitude and longitude can be found). The resulting file was reformatted to present in ascii, comma delimited text and MS-DOS text (table layout) on the MCM LTER web site. Both of these files are linked to this web page above. </literalLayout>

<literalLayout> The experimental design was a randomized block, with 5 replicates per
treatment.  Within each block were 3 plots measuring approximately 1m x 1m, with a
central circular area of 85 cm diameter (approx.  0.57 m2) used for
treatments and sampling.  The treatments were as follows:

(C) control plots (no manipulations), 
(W) nanopure water added to field capacity to 10 cm depth (5.6 L/plot), 
(WS) sucrose added in solution (15.82 g sucrose in 5.6 L water per plot).

  
	  
Soil samples were taken for organism enumeration and moisture content analysis as
follows:  Sampling bags were prepared with one sterile 'Whirlpak' bag and clean
plastic scoop per sample.  Samples were taken from within the 85 cm diameter circular
area of each plot starting at the 12:00 position on the first day.  The above
treatments were then applied to the plots.  The 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions were
then sampled for each successive date.  The location of the sampling was recorded
each time so that areas were not re-sampled.  Using the plastic scoop, soil was
collected to a 10 cm depth.  Very large rocks (&gt;20 mm diameter) were excluded from the
sample.  The soil was shoveled into the 'Whirlpak' bag until three quarters full
(about 1.5 kg soil).  The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed
tightly, expelling as much air as possible.  The soil samples were stored in a cooler
for transportation.  On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the
soils were stored at 5 degrees C until further processing.  


In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent
contamination.  The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening.
Approximately 200 cm3 of soil was placed in a pre-weighed 800mL plastic beaker.
Rocks greater than 3-4mm in diameter were removed from the sample.  A sub-sample of
approximately 50g was removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum dish, and weighed on a
balance accurate to 0.01g.  This sample was dried at 105 degrees C for 24 hours.  The sample was
removed, placed in a desiccator to cool down, and re-weighed.  These data were used to
calculate water content of the soil and to express data as numbers of soil organisms per
unit dry weight of soil.  The remaining soil in the plastic beaker was weighed.  Cold tap
water was added up to 650 mL.  The soil suspension was stirred carefully (star stir or
figure of 8) for 30 seconds, using a spatula.  Immediately the liquid was poured into wet
screens - a stack of 40 mesh on top of a 400 mesh.  The screens were rinsed gently with ice
cold tap water (from a wash bottle) through the top of the stack, keeping the screens at an
angle as the water filtered through.  The water was kept on ice at all times.  The top
screen was removed, and the lower screen rinsed top down, never directly on top of the
soil, but at the top of the screen and from behind.  The water was allowed to cascade down
and carry the particles into the bottom wedge of the angled screen.  The side of the screen
was tapped gently to filter all the water through.  The suspension was rinsed from the
front and the back, keeping the screen at an angle and not allowing the water to overflow
the edge of the screen.  The soil particles were backwashed into a 50mL plastic centrifuge
tube, tipping the screen into the funnel above the tube and rinsing the funnel gently.  The
suspension was centrifuged for five minutes at 1744 RPM.  The liquid was decanted, leaving
a few mL on top of the soil particles.  The tube was filled with sucrose solution (454g
sucrose per liter of tap water, kept refrigerated) up to 45mL.  This was stirred gently
with a spatula until the pellet was broken up and suspended.  The suspension was
centrifuged for one minute at 1744 RPM, decanted into a wet 500 mesh screen, rinsed well
with ice cold tap water and backwashed into a centrifuge tube.  Samples were refrigerated
at 5 degrees C until counted.
  

Samples were washed into a counting dish and examined under a microscope at x10 or x20
magnification.  Rotifers and tardigrades were identified and counted.  Nematodes were
identified to species and sex, and counted.  Total numbers in each sample were recorded on
data sheets.  All species of nematode, and all rotifers and tardigrades found in the sample
were recorded.  Data were entered in to Excel files, printed, and checked for errors.
