    <section>
      <para>Shrub encroachment alters community dynamics and ecosystem functioning worldwide. Grazing increases shrub encroachment as herbivores selectively consume grasses, easing the advancement of shrubs. Diversity decreases with shrub invasion and species richness drops by half when semiarid grasslands become shrublands. A shift in dominance from grasses to shrubs changes community structure and lowers community stability by increasing species turnover. Transition to shrubland also increases regional winter low temperatures by nearly 2&#730;C. Soil resource distributions change in invaded grasslands as shrubs create islands of fertility and alter nutrient cycles.  Soil under plants has higher infiltration rates than interspaces and at the SNWR shrublands have twice as much interspace area than grasslands, leading to higher runoff. Greater runoff also leads to greater soil and nutrient removal.  Shrub encroachment in the Southwest has increased dramatically over the past 150 years and is presumably linked to intensified human impacts. One local example of shrub encroachment is the expansion of creosote (Larrea tridentata) within Chihuahuan Desert grasslands. Chihuahuan Desert grasslands stretch from central Mexico to central New Mexico and are dominated by black grama.  Winter low temperatures limit northward creosote expansion.  Over the past century winter low temperature have increased&#160;2&#730;C&#160;within some areas of the Southwest. With nighttime temperatures predicted to continue increasing, temperature limitations of creosote distribution may be relaxed.  Within central New Mexico lies the transition between Chihuahuan Desert grassland and Colorado plateau shortgrass steppe, dominated by blue grama.  Although temperature and climate are similar at the boundary between these ecosystems, creosote is only found in black grama grasslands and not in blue grama grasslands.  Soil texture varies between the two grasslands and has been suggested as a major factor restricting creosote expansion along the transition. However, the affect of soil texture on creosote expansion has not been directly tested. The main research questions were: i) Can creosote germinate in blue grama grasslands? ii) Does grazing influence creosote germination in semiarid grasslands?</para>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Blue Grama core site is one of five core SEV LTER study sites. Meteorological trends, rodent abundance, pollinator diversity, phenology, and NPP are all being investigated. Additional studies have examined the Bootleg Canyon fire of 1998 and subsequent effects on the patch dynamics of grasses.Vegetation: Vegetation is characterized as Plains-Mesa Grassland, dominated by blue and black grama (Bouteloua gracilis and B. eriopoda) and galleta grass (Pleuraphis jamesii). , </geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points Black Grama is on the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitat. The site is subject to intensive research activity, including assessments of net primary productivity, phenology, and pollinator diversity, amongst other projects.&#160; It is the site of the unburned black grama (GU) component of the Burn NPP study.
On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the Five Points Black Grama site.&#160; Portions of this site were burned, but not the entirety.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the burn.
&#160;Vegetation: The Five Points Black Grama site is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary. Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda)., </geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Five Points area emcompasses both the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote study sites.&#160; Five Points falls along the transition between the Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats.&#160; Both core sites are subject to intensive research activities, including NPP measurements, phenology observations, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments.&#160; There are rain-out shelters for drought studies in both the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote sites.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosote overstory, with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (Opuntia macrocentra), and soapweed yucca as co-occurring shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous, dense, grass-dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama Site.  Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bushmuhly (Muhlenbergia porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii).  Notable forbs include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallows (Sphaeralcea spp.)., siteid: 3</geographicDescription>

          <para>
            <literalLayout>Creosote seeds were collected from the SNWR and planted within 3 days to prevent seeds from entering dormancy. Germination success is highly variable between creosote individuals therefore seeds were collected from 15 individual shrubs and the identity of each mother plant was maintained throughout the experiment. At grassland sites, three treatments included planting in interspaces, grass patches, and under clipped grasses to simulate grazing. There was no grass at the creosote site so seeds were only planted under shrubs and interspaces. For each replicate, 10 seeds were planted inside a seed collar with closed sides, an open bottom and screened top to prevent rodent disturbance. Control collars for each treatment were deployed without seed addition to determine background creosote germination from the seed bank. Seed collars were planted in linear transects with the treatment (interspace, grass, grazed, interspace control, grass control, grazed control) and mother plant ID (1 - 15) completely randomized along a transect. There were 5 replicate transects per site. Grassland transects contained 60 seed collars and shrubland transects contained 40 seed collars for a total of 800 seed collars. Creosote germination requires ample moisture, so for a month following planting seeds were watered weekly with a 2.5 cm rain event if no precipitation occurred. Seeds were planted on August 30th, 2010. Based on greenhouse experiments, germination was expected to occur within 10 to 14 days. Seed collars were checked for germination on a weekly basis for a month following planting. At the end of the experiment no germination had occurred.</literalLayout>
