    <abstract>
      <para>One technique that has been used to analyze individual atmospheric particles is
                automated electron microscopy. This technique gives the size, shape, and elemental
                composition of individual particles and has been used successfully for particles
                collected on filters in particle samplers. The goal of the current project is to
                mimic this electron microscopy analysis technique for particles deposited on leaf
                surfaces. Preliminary results demonstrate that electron microscopy can be used
                successfully to analyze individual particles on leaf surfaces.</para>
      <para>The ability to analyze atmospheric particles on leaf surfaces leads to a specific
                application: determining the spatial distribution of atmospheric particles
                throughout urban areas, namely Phoenix. Evidence from past studies in Phoenix
                indicate that the distribution of particle types is non-uniform, and sampling with a
                limited number of particle samplers is not adequate for capturing this variability.
                Using leaves gives the ability to sample in more locations. In a preliminary study,
                three sampling locations from the Phoenix area - a desert, an urban, and a suburban
                site - were chosen as test sites to determine whether different particle types could
                be observed on leaf surfaces from the different sites. The particle types from the
                desert site contain only elements comprising desert dust. The particle types from
                the urban and suburban sites consist partially of elements found in desert dust, but
                they also contain sulfur, which is likely from anthropogenic sources within the
                urban area. These preliminary results indicate that the distribution of particle
                types throughout an urban area can be determined from the analysis of particles on
                leaf surfaces.</para>
      <para>A more detailed study is in progress. Leaves from twenty-eight sampling sites
                around the Phoenix area have been collected and will be analyzed with a method
                similar to that used in the preliminary study. The twenty-eight sites were chosen
                based on land-use data. In addition to determining the spatial distribution of
                particle types, another objective of this work correlate the particle types with the
                land-use data from which they were collected.</para>

            <para>In order to satisfy the objectives of characterizing deposited
                            particles and determining their spatial deposition patterns, four sets
                            of leaf and filter samples were collected (Table 3-1): 1) mesquite
                            leaves from twenty trees within the Phoenix metropolitan area on two
                            days; 2) eight leaves from one tree at one time; 3) six sets of filter
                            and leaf samples from one tree over a period of three weeks; and 4)
                            filters that were placed in ten trees for six days. For each sample,
                            leaves or filters were collected or placed near the edges of the trees
                            at approximately 2.5 m above the ground with few or no leaves above
                            them. All samples were analyzed with an electron microprobe and
                            subjected to multivariate analysis.</para>
            <para>Mesquite leaves were collected on June 19 and 29, 2001, from twenty
                            locations within the Phoenix metropolitan area (Figure 3-1). The leaves
                            were dried at room temperature for at least two weeks. Square portions
                            of each leaf, approximately 2 mm per side, were affixed to an aluminum
                            stub with conductive carbon tape. One leaf per tree was analyzed.</para>
            <para>In order to determine the spatial variability of deposited particles
                            on leaves within one tree, eight leaves were collected from a tree on
                            June 8, 2002. The leaves were collected from the north, northeast, east,
                            southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest sides of the tree. A
                            Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was performed on the concentrations of
                            66</para>
            <para>the analyzed particle groups. We chose the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test
                            because it is a nonparametric test in which the distribution of the
                            sample does not need to be known.</para>
            <para>The third data set involved the simultaneous collection of leaves and
                            filters from one tree during April 2001. The purpose of this data
                            collection was to compare the particle types between the leaves and
                            filters in order to identify the particles that were deposited. Because
                            the filter was clean when it was placed in the tree, the particles on
                            the filter were assumed to be deposited from the area surrounding the
                            exposed filter. Particles that were observed on both the filter and
                            leaves were considered deposited. Particle types that differed between
                            the two surfaces were examined to determine their origins.</para>
            <para>For this collection, a square piece of Nuclepore polycarbonate filter,
                            approximately 5 mm on a side, was affixed to an aluminum stub and placed
                            on a mesquite tree branch. Polycarbonate filters were chosen because
                            they are commonly used in particle samplers for individual-particle
                            analysis (Post and Buseck, 1984; Katrinak et al., 1995; Anderson et al.,
                            1996; Gao and Anderson, 2001). The filter remained in the tree from two
                            to seven days. When the filter was collected, leaves near the filter
                            were also collected, and a clean filter was placed into the tree. Six
                            filter and six leaf samples were collected over a three-week period. The
                            resulting compositions and sizes of the particle groups on the leaves
                            and filters were compared.</para>
            <para>The purpose of the fourth set of data was to obtain spatial deposition
                            patterns of particle groups collected on filters. These results were
                            then compared with those 67</para>
            <para>collected on leaves. Polycarbonate filters were affixed to aluminum
                            stubs and placed in trees at ten sampling locations from October 29 to
                            November 4, 2002 (Figure 3-1).</para>

            <title>Automated Electron Microprobe Analysis</title>
            <para>Before analysis in the microprobe, all leaf and filter samples were
                            carbon-coated to improve conductivity. The individual-particle analysis
                            technique was similar to that used in previous studies (Anderson et al.,
                            1992, 1996; Katrinak et al., 1995). We used an automated JEOL Model
                            JXA-8600 electron microprobe with NORAN Voyager-IV image analysis and
                            automation and equipped with a NORAN Be-window energy-dispersive x-ray
                            spectrometer (EDS).</para>
            <para>We used the following operating conditions: accelerating voltage - 15
                            kV, beam current - 400 pA, working distance - 11 mm, and magnification -
                            4,000x. X-ray spectra were acquired for 60 seconds at energies between 0
                            - 20 keV; relative dead times were less than 30%. We analyzed 50 to 400
                            particles per sample.</para>
            <para>Back-scattered electron (BSE) images were obtained with an annular,
                            split-ring, semi-conductor detector, mounted 11 mm from the sample. BSE
                            images were preferred over secondary-electron images because the atomic
                            number contrast is greater, little topographic information is revealed,
                            and the effects of electron-beam charging are reduced, all of which are
                            important in the analysis of individual particles (Germani and Buseck,
                            1991). The greater atomic number contrast was especially important on
                            the leaves, where the greater contrast allowed for the analysis of
                            particles with similar 68</para>
            <para>compositions to the leaves. The resolution for each image frame was
                            1,024 by 1,024 pixels, and each pixel width was 0.022 &#956;m. The final BSE
                            image was produced from the average of three images, each with dwell
                            times of 3,200 microseconds per pixel.</para>
            <para>The analyses were performed on the smooth portions of the leaves to
                            maintain the focus in the images, a necessary condition for the
                            analysis. Although in previous studies with oak leaves, more particles
                            were observed on surface irregularities, such as veins, than on smooth
                            portions of leaves (Lindberg et al., 1982; Coe and Lindberg, 1987), we
                            did not notice a significant difference on mesquite leaves. The
                            upward-facing surfaces of the leaves were analyzed, as more particles
                            were observed there, as opposed to the downward-facing surfaces
                            (Lindberg and Lovett, 1985; Coe and Lindberg, 1987; Nicholson,
                            1988).</para>
            <para>The particles were distinguished from the leaf and filter surfaces by
                            segmentation of the BSE images into binary images. In this process, the
                            gray-level for each pixel was compared with a user-defined threshold
                            gray-level. The pixels with values greater than the threshold value were
                            assigned one; particles appeared in these pixels. The pixels with
                            gray-levels less than the threshold value were assigned zero; these
                            pixels contained the leaf and filter surfaces. At times, the
                            segmentation procedure produced artifacts from the leaf, because, in
                            some cases, leaf material was slightly above the threshold; in these
                            instances, the composition data was useful for distinguishing artifacts
                            from true particles.</para>
            <para>Size and chemical analyses were performed for each particle. In the
                            size analysis, we determined the area, length, width, perimeter, aspect
                            ratio, circularity, and location for each particle. For the chemical
                            analysis, a rectangular area surrounding the particle was 69</para>
            <para>analyzed; the longest side of the rectangle equaled the length of the
                            particle. Because a small fraction of the rectangular area consisted of
                            the sampling substrate, either leaf or filter, x-rays were emitted from
                            the sampling surface. For most analyses, these x-ray counts were low
                            compared to those for the particles; although, for some of the smaller
                            particles on the leaf samples, elements from the leaf did appear in the
                            analysis results.</para>
            <para>The x-ray spectra were quantified by comparing each particle spectrum
                            with standard spectra for 24 elements: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca,
                            Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Br, I, Ba, Pb, Ni, A, Sn, Sb, Se, Zn, and Cu. The
                            quantified spectra were reported in unnormalized weight percents. With
                            the Be window on the EDS, energies from elements lighter than Na could
                            not be detected.</para>
            <para>Detection limits were applied to the weight percents of each particle
                            before input to a cluster routine. The weight percents below the
                            specified detection limits were given a value of zero, whereas those
                            above the limits did not change. The use of detection limits is
                            essential for cluster analysis of the data.</para>
