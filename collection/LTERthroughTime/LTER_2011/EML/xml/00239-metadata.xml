    <section>
      <para>The water balance vegetation plots were part of a larger water balance monitoring project at the Sevilleta LTER.  The plots were designed to measure the percent cover of photosynthetic/transpiring (green) plant species at specific sites where time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes and weather stations were already installed.&#160;  In 1995, there were three sites (Field Station, Deep Well and Rio Salado).  A 30m x 30m plot was installed at each site, and collection of vegetation data commenced in July 1995.  Percent cover (green) and species identities were recorded monthly at a representative sample of 1m square quadrats within each plot.&#160;&#160;</para>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Deep Well is located on McKenzie Flats and is site of the longest running SEV LTER met station, number 40, which has been active since 1988.&#160; In addition to studies of meteorological variables, core line-intercept vegetation transects and line-intercept transects from the 1995 and 2001 Deep Well fires are sampled here.&#160; The mini-rhizotron study, blue and black grama compositional comparison, blue and black grama patch dynamics investigation, and kangaroo rat population assessement are all ongoing here.&#160; Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is also the location of the warming and monsoon experiments, as well as portions of the line-intercept and vegetation removal studies.
On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the area of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed.&#160; While portions of this site were burned, the entirety was not.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the fire.Vegetation: The vegetation of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is Chihuahuan Desert Grassland, dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) and blue grama (B. gracilis).  Other grasses found at the site include dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) and threeawns (Aristida spp.).  Shrubs are uncommon but those that occur include Yucca glauca, Ephedra torreyi, and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens). Herbaceous plants include Plantago purshii, Hymenopappus filifolius, and globe mallows (Sphaeralcea spp.).

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Rio Salado is an ephemeral tributary of the Rio Grande on the west side of the Sevilleta NWR, flowing west by northwest to east by southeast. Rio Salado Grassland and Rio Salado Larrea are two study sites established in 1989. These sites were established&#160;as counterparts to sites at Five Points. Between 1989 and 1998, vegetation, litter decomposition, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent populations were studied at both sites. Core studies at these sites were largely terminated in 1998, although rodent populations are still monitored at the Rio Salado Larrea site as the Small Mammal Exclosure Study's Larrea plots are co-located there. Rio Salado Grassland is the location of Met Station 44. The Rio Salado study sites are accessed by taking the San Acacia exit, going west and then taking the frontage road back north to the Sevilleta NWR gate.&#160; After entering the refuge turn left after 0.2 mi and take this road 1.4 mi to a "T" in the road at the power lines.&#160; An earthen berm stops road travel here and the met station is located about 300 m west on the blocked road. &#160; Vegetation: The Rio Salado Grassland site is Plains-Mesa Sand Scrub habitat characterized by
stabilized deep-sand dominated by coppice dunes of honey mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa). Co-dominant shrubs are sand sagebrush (Artemesia filifolia) and
fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), with winterfat (Krascheninnikovia
lanata), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), broom indigobush (Psorothamnus
scoparius), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia
sarothrae) as other notable shrubs. One-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) is
present as well, especially along shallow washes. Compared to the Black Grama
Core Site, grass cover is sparse and dominated by poverty threeawn (Aristida
divaricata), Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides), mesa and spike dropseed
(Sporobolus cryptandrus and S. contractus), as well as patches of black grama
(Bouteloua eriopoda). Notable forbs included spectaclepod (Dimorphocarpa
wislizenii), tansy aster (Machaeranthera tanacetifolia), desert marigold
(Baileya multiradiata), Abert buckwheat (Eriogonum abertianum), dwarf gilia
(Ipomopsis pumila), rattlesnake weed (Chamaesyce albomarginata), blunt
tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala),
and Rocky Mountain zinnia (Zinnia grandiflora)., siteid: 13</geographicDescription>

            <literalLayout>Study Plots - Each of the three plots was 30m x 30m (900 m squared). Eleven lines and eleven rows of small wooden pegs were placed in an evenly-spaced manner, as shown in the diagram below.  Each peg was about 3 meters from the next in the grid. Therefore, the lines and rows were numbered by 3's.  For monthly data collection, a one meter square quadrat was placed so that the peg was at the northeast corner.  The 0th line and 0th row of pegs served as borders on two sides of the plot and also as anchors for the NE corners of quadrats.  The 30th line and 30th row of pegs served only as borders on the other two sides of the plot.The Field Station (fs) and Deep Well (dw) sites were oriented as in the diagram below.  The Rio Salado (rs) plot was a mirror image of this, so that row '0' is on the west side of the plot and rows run from west to east. The lines remained the same, running from north to south.</literalLayout>

            <literalLayout>Sample frequency and size - Plots were  sampled once per month, near the middle of the month, from January through December (in 1995, sampling did not begin until July.).To obtain accurate estimates  of the mean percent green cover of each guild, including annuals,  perennials, grasses, forbs, and creosote bush, with the least amount of  effort and time, both running means and boot strap analyses were performed.   This was originally proposed by Bruce Milne (for detail, see  /research//local/plant/src/plantcover/field_methods) and implemented by  Yeulong Yang using SAS.  The SAS program used to determine the sample  size is called "swb_size.sas", located at  /research/local/plant/src/plantcover. Documentation can be found  at the beginning of the SAS program.  Based on the results of the running  mean analyses, a minimum of 60 quads was needed.  From that point on,  only 60 quads per plot were sampled by the field crew. Equipment - Equipment included meter quadrat  frames, tape recorders, and microcassettes.  Quadrat frames were made of  1/2 " PVC and PVC corners, with 10 cm lengths marked using black  electrical tape.  Each 10 cm square within the quadrat would therefore  comprise 1% of the area. Recording data - The person recording data first  placed the quadrat frame on the ground with the NE corner inside of the  wooden peg and the SW corner inside of a PVC peg placed as a  marker.  A brief note was left on the microcasette and a similar introductory  statement taped at the beginning of data collection (e.g. "Jan. 18.  1996, Susan Geer, Rio Salado water balance plot").Only species which had some green were  identified.  Many times it was hard to tell whether foliage was green.   It was easier to determine foliage color when the sun was not directly  overhead. Geen foliage was mentally combined and tallyed to the nearest percent. Anytime  green foliage occupied less than half of a 10 cm square area (less than 0.5%),  it was classified as "trace." If between 0.5% and 1% was occupied, cover was rounded up  to 1%.      All foliage that was not green at the time of sampling was  classified as "litter."  The following is an example of what  might have been recorded for one quadrat:  "Begin quad 0 0.  Gutierrezia  sarothrae 5, Dalea jamesii 1, Psilotrope tagetina +, litter 45.  End  quad 0 0". Consistency of estimates - To ensure that cover estimates were always made in the same way, the  crew leader served as the standard.  Before gathering data, each group  of plant crew members had a training session in which the crew leader  demonstrated collection of percent cover for green foliage only.&#160; The crew did  about 10 quadrats as a group, and then members all gathered data  independently for another set of quadrats.  A crew member estimating  cover differently would recieve extra training and practice.    Data  were compared to detect differences between crew members in September.The SAS program used to estimate the differences among  crew members is called PerDiff.sas, located at  /research/local/plant/src/plantcover. Based on the results of such  analyses, differences in percent cover were mainly due to site and  guild and there were no significant differences among the crew members.   A brief documentation can be found at the beginning of the PerDiff.sas  program. Data entry - Data were entered by each  crew member using dictaphones to transcribe the microcassttes directly to  the computer.  The dictaphones were equipped with footpedals and  headphones.  Therefore, hands were free for data entry.  Data were  entered using the "emacs" text editor.  Each entry line consisted of  line, row, plant or litter code, and percent cover. Codes - Sevilleta plant codes for 1995  (Appendix B) were used, as well as the code "LITT" for litter.  The  definition of litter for this particular data set is simply non-green  organic matter.  This non-green organic matter is often part of a plant  that is green as well.  In fact, during the winter months only a few plants had green foliage on them.  Here is an example of data entered from one quadrat at line 0, row 0:  0 0 GUSA2 50 0 DAJA 10 0  PSTAT +0 0 LITT 45. Lineup program - Data for each site were  compiled by the crew leader. Date and site were added to all  entries, and spacing standardized, using a program called  "lineup."  After compiling data for a site, the following command was entered:   more thanlineup filename yyyymmdd si  more than tempfile  in which  "filename" was the name of the file, "yyyy" was the full year, "mm" was a  two number code for month, "dd" the date, "si" a two letter code for  location, and "tempfile" a temporary file to hold the modified data.     After scanning for errors, the data for each site was appended  to the file "water_balance_1995."</literalLayout>
