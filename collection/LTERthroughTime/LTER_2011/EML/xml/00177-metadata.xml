            <para>The experimental site was comprised of fourteen 10-m x 10-m plots.
                            During May 1999, each plot was planted with trees, shrubs, and ground
                            covers based on the number and life forms of vegetation in xeric style
                            residential landscape plots surveyed in the Phoenix metropolitan area. A
                            2.5-m wide strip of unvegetated soil was maintained between each plot.
                            Each 100-m2 plot was divided into equal quadrants and planted with one
                            each of 19-L container grown Eucalyptus microtheca F. Muell. Blue Ghost
                            (coolibah) and Quercus virginiana var. fusiformis (Small) Sarg. (Texas
                            live oak) in opposite corner quadrants. Six each of 3.8-L containergrown
                            clones of Nerium oleander L. Sister Agnes (oleander) and Leucophyllum
                            frutescens var. green cloud Berl. (Texas sage) spaced approximately 1.5
                            m on center and grouped in opposite diagonal quadrants of the plot were
                            installed in the remaining two quadrants. Rosmarinus officinalis L
                            Prostratus (prostrate rosemary) was used as a ground cover and one each
                            of 3.8L clones were planted in each plot near the center in the quadrant
                            occupied by L. frutescens . To facilitate establishment, plants in all
                            plots were drip irrigated at a similar rate (416 L m-2 yr-1) for the
                            first six months after transplanting. To reduce effects of possible soil
                            nutrient heterogeneity, all plants were fertilized initially and
                            subsequently each April with controlled release fertilizer 20N-4.4P-4K
                            plus micronutrients (Best Paks, J.R. Simplot Co, Boise, Idaho).</para>

            <title>Experimental design</title>
            <para>Beginning January 2000, plots were subjected to a two by four
                            factorial treatment combination of drip irrigation rate and shrub
                            pruning regime for 3 years. Irrigation treatments were defined as low
                            rate (mean 814 L m-2 yr-1) and high rate (mean 1954 L m-2 yr-1). Pruning
                            treatments included hedging Nerium and Leucophyllum every 6 weeks or 6
                            months, yearly renewal pruning those taxa to the ground, or leaving them
                            unpruned. Irrigation treatments were blocked in seven rows of two plots,
                            one of each irrigation rate treatment, running in a north to south
                            direction, with the four shrub pruning treatments randomly assigned to
                            entire plots within that scheme. Water was delivered by an automatic
                            irrigation system to each plant through drip emitters situated under the
                            canopy near the base of each shrub or ground cover and under the canopy
                            near the trunk of each tree. During the first year, irrigation to tree
                            species was supplied by two 3.8 L hr-1 emitters each and to shrubs and
                            ground covers by one 3.8 L hr-1 emitter each. During the second year,
                            the number of emitters supplying Eucalyptus was increased to four, and
                            during the third year to six. Also during the third year, the number of
                            emitters to Quercus was increased to three and to both shrub species was
                            increased to two. The volume of water applied to each plot was monitored
                            using totalizing water meters (Precision Manufacturing Company, Orlando,
                            Fla.). The volume of irrigation to each plant was calculated as the
                            total volume of water delivered to a plot over time divided by the
                            fraction of total emitters on the plot for each plant. The irrigation
                            rate was calculated as volume per m2 of plot area per year. Irrigations
                            were scheduled to give plants in the high irrigation rate plots twice as
                            much water as those in the low rate irrigation rate plots and both were
                            ramped seasonally. The irrigation rate treatments were based on a
                            previous assessment of landscape irrigation application rates by local
                            residents. Precipitation was measured via tipping bucket (Model TE525WS,
                            Campbell Scientific, Ogden, Utah) and soil moisture content was
                            monitored at a depth of approximately 30 cm in unirrigated soil and for
                            three replicates of each irrigation rate treatment using soil moisture
                            probes (ThetaProbe, Dynamax, Inc, Houston, Texas). Moisture probes were
                            situated below the canopy near the base of each of the two pruned shrubs
                            species and approximately 1 m from the based of E. microtheca .
                            Precipitation and soil moisture data were recorded with a 23X
                            micrologger (Campbell Scientific). Mean annual soil moisture content
                            (v/v) was 6.1, 12.9, and 16.7percent for dry soil, low irrigation rate,
                            and high irrigation rates, respectively. For three years pruning
                            treatments were applied to N. oleander and L. frutescens in two plots
                            for each irrigation treatment (4 plots x 3 pruning treatments). Shrubs
                            were either hedged every six weeks, hedged every six months during
                            February and August or renewal pruned to the ground yearly during
                            February (n equals 2 plots and 12 pseudo replicates of each shrub for
                            each pruning treatment). In addition, shrubs in one plot within each
                            irrigation treatment were left unpruned as controls (n equals 1 plot and
                            6 pseudo replicates of each shrub species for each irrigation x pruning
                            treatment combination). Tree canopies were thinned and the base elevated
                            yearly and similarly and Rosmarinus was left unpruned on all
                            plots.</para>

            <para>The size of all plants was measured every three months. For trees,
                            height, diameter, canopy area and canopy base height were measured with
                            a clinometer and steel tapes. Tree canopy area was calculated as A
                            equals pi(0.5 * ((NS + EW)/2))2 where A is canopy area, NS is the
                            measured north/south dimension of canopy, and EW is the measured
                            east/west dimension of canopy, assuming a tree canopy to be circular
                            with a radius of half the average diameter. Shrubs were also measured
                            before and after each pruning event. For shrubs and ground covers,
                            canopy volume (height x width EW x width NS) was measured. All pruned
                            biomass and accumulated litter (green waste, GW) from each plant was
                            collected at pruning events, oven dried for 7 days at 70 degree C and
                            weighed. Leaf surface area to dry weight (DW) relationships were
                            established using regression analysis by measuring surface area of 100
                            leaves of each species using a digitizing camera system interfaced to a
                            computer and drying and recording mass after leaves were dried for 3
                            days at 60 degrees C (Appendix A). At the end of three years, all shrubs
                            and ground covers were pruned to the ground and fresh weight (FW) of all
                            pruned material measured. All plants with final FW less than 2 kg were
                            dried and weighed, as were all Rosmarinus and 3 replicates of Nerium and
                            Leucophyllum from each plot. The remaining Nerium and Leucophyllum were
                            sub-sampled and total DW was calculated based on FW/DW ratios of each
                            plant. Leaf material was separated from woody material of harvested
                            plants and leaf DW was used to estimate final canopy leaf area (LA). For
                            Eucalyptus, standing biomass was estimated by the equation: loge DW
                            equals -3.8604 + 0.9644 loge (DBH2 x height) and LA was estimated via
                            canopy area, assuming a leaf area index (LAI) of 2.19. Standing biomass
                            of Quercus was estimated using the equation: DW equals -0.086 + 0.05 (d)
                            where d is the trunk diameter at 15 cm and LA was calculated via canopy
                            area assuming an LAI of 0.66. Plot PP was calculated as the sum of
                            estimated tree standing biomass and total biomass removed via pruning
                            and destructive harvest. Irrigation water use efficiency (WUEI) was
                            calculated for each plant as PP per total volume of irrigation water
                            applied for three years. Precipitation was assumed to be equal to all
                            plants and had negligible affect on available soil moisture relative to
                            irrigation so was not considered in WUEI calculations. For trees, LA
                            over time was estimated via measured canopy area and LAI. Regressions of
                            final LA on standing shrub canopy volume were used to estimate shrub LA
                            over time. Average LA for each plant was calculated from all
                            measurements made during the 3 year study, and total plot average LA was
                            the sum of the average LA for all plants on a plot. Average LAI was
                            calculated for the shrubs as estimated LA/canopy area over three
                            years.</para>

            <title>Plant gas exchange</title>
            <para>On two consecutive days every 3 months from October 2000 until October
                            2002, maximum plant gas exchange fluxes were measured for the most
                            recently physiologically mature plant tissues and consisted of partial
                            leaves (Nerium and Eucalyptus), whole leaves (Quercus), or small shoot
                            segments (Leucophyllum and Rosmarinus) of all plants. Measurements were
                            made on cloudless days during a 3 hour time frame previously determined
                            to be that of optimal conditions for maximum gas exchange fluxes for
                            that season. Measurements were made the day after a watering event for
                            each irrigation treatment (two sampling days) to reflect fluxes under
                            conditions of maximum water availability. Measurements were made with a
                            quarter-liter chamber connected to a portable infrared gas analyzer
                            (Model LI 6250, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) operated in closed system
                            mode. The chamber thermocouple was positioned in direct contact with the
                            abaxial surface of measured leaves and stems to measure shoot
                            temperature. To reduce the potential errors associated with measuring
                            plant gas exchange in an enclosed chamber, particularly with respect to
                            leaf conductance (gs) and transpiration (E) as a measure of actual leaf
                            gs and E under field conditions, a sampling protocol for gas exchange
                            measurements that consisted of short measurement intervals (10-30
                            seconds) to minimize changes in the chamber microenvironment during the
                            sampling interval, followed by exhaustion of the chamber volume to
                            return to ambient conditions, was employed. Typical chamber
                            microenvironmental conditions were as follows: initial CO2 concentration
                            ranged from 355 to 409 ppm and drawn down was less than 1 ppm per
                            second; flow rate was adjusted to maintain chamber relative humidity
                            within 10% of ambient and for a given measurement leaf to air
                            temperature differential was less than 0.5C. Instrument derived values
                            for E compared with values calculated from measured gs and vapor
                            pressure deficit (VPD) via the formula: E equals gs * VPD/p, where p is
                            local barometric pressure were similar via paired t-test, so instrument
                            derived values for E were used for subsequent scaling activities. For
                            each of the 9 seasonal 2-day sampling periods, 10 leaf or shoot
                            replicate measures for each irrigation x pruning interaction (n equals
                            80 each species) of Nerium and Leucophyllum and 20 replicate measures
                            for each irrigation treatment (n equals 40 each species) for other
                            species were made. Total number of gas exchange measurements made for
                            each 2-day seasonal sampling period was 280 except the first two
                            measurement periods, during which control plants and those pruned yearly
                            were indistinguishable. For large leaves, a known surface area was
                            enclosed in the chamber and smaller leaves or shoot segments were
                            harvested and total one sided surface area was measured with a
                            digitizing camera system interfaced to a computer to calculate fluxes
                            per unit leaf area.</para>
