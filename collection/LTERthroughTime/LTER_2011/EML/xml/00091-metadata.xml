    <abstract>
            <para>
                Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem ecologists study the same phenomena
          (e.g., nutrient cycling, energy flow, succession) but they do so within separate
          conceptual frameworks. Terrestrial frameworks address state factors of climate,
          organisms, parent material, topography, and time to understand ecosystem
          processes within a location, but less often consider how ecosystems are
          connected. Aquatic ecologists, especially those studying flowing waters,
          emphasize the role of water as a means of propagating processes and materials
          through space and time. Both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems contain
          hydrologic vectors as well as soils or sediments that record the influences of
          state factors. This dissertation is an investigation of carbon and nitrogen
          cycling in the stream-riparian corridor of the San Pedro River, a large desert
          river, and tests the relative effects of soil characteristics and hydrologic
          vectors. Riparian zones are well suited to such investigations because they are
          spatially heterogeneous and subject to material and water inputs from multiple
          hydrologic vectors. Spatially explicit methods showed that flood vectors
          homogenized soil characteristics and denitrification along a stream reach with
          frequent overbank floods, whereas soils of a riparian site that was infrequently
          inundated by floods were heterogeneous. Legacies of previous floods appeared to
          determine the spatial locations of denitrification at the latter site. At a plot
          scale, manipulation of precipitation and flood vectors across a gradient of soil
          types showed that water functioned as an essential resource during the dry
          season, resulting in increased emissions of trace gases following simulation of
          floods. Following inundation of riparian soils by several monsoon floods,
          however, further addition of water appeared to suppress biogeochemical activity
          by decreasing oxygen availability. Thus desert riparian ecosystems appear to
          shift seasonally along a terrestrial-aquatic continuum, functioning similarly to
          terrestrial ecosystems during dry seasons, but like wetlands following
          inundation by floods. Finally, analyses encompassing several years of
          observations revealed strong correlations between regimes of hydrology and
          resource availability. Overall, this study demonstrates that the hydrologic
          regime drives spatial and temporal patterns in biogeochemical processes, but
          that soil characteristics may modify the duration and magnitude of biological
          responses to hydrologic vectors in desert riparian ecosystems.

            <para>
                            The study was conducted in riparian floodplains of the
                San Pedro River during the dry and monsoon seasons in summers of
                2005 and 2007. The upper basin of the San Pedro (~7,600 km2) is
                drained by an unregulated, perennially flowing river near the
                Sonoran-Chihuahuan desert transition. Plots were established at two
                study sites, which were similar in hydrologic and biological
                features. Results did not differ significantly between sites and
                distinctions are therefore not made between the sites. The study
                sites lie at approximately 1300 m elevation and receive 300 to 750
                mm of precipitation annually, largely confined to two distinct
                seasons: winter rains (December-March) and summer monsoon storms
                (July-September). A hot, dry summer (May-July) precedes the monsoon
                season. Median of daily stream discharge values during the dry
                season of both years was 0.05 m3 s-1 (USGS gage #09471000, located
                ~3 and10.5 km downstream from the study sites). Median discharge of
                the monsoon season was 1.42 m3 s-1 in 2005 and 0.58 m3 s-1 in 2007.
                Flash floods of instantaneous discharge &gt;30 m3 s-1 inundated
                the floodplains during both study years.
            </para>
            <para>
                            Field sampling was conducted in wide riparian floodplains
                (&gt;250 m) along gaining reaches (Pool and Coes 1999, Baillie
                et al. 2007) of the stream. The sites feature perennial stream flow,
                shallow groundwater, abundant hydric plant species, and productive
                vegetation. Such sites are typical of riparian ecosystems within the
                Upper San Pedro Basin (Brooks and Lemon 2007, Stromberg et al.
                2007). Vegetative communities are dominated by cottonwood trees
                (Populus fremontii), seepwillow shrubs (Baccharis salicifolia and B.
                emoryi), native bunchgrass (Sporobolus wrightii) and two invasive
                grasses: Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense) and Bermuda grass
                (Cynodon dactylon). A layer of cottonwood leaf litter covers the
                soil surface throughout much of the study site. Soils are spatially
                heterogeneous and experimental plots were selected to encompass this
                variation. Soil texture of sampled plots ranged from sandy loam to
                clay loam.
            </para>
            <para>
                            Prior to wetting experiments, soils were collected from
                each plot for determination of nutrient and organic matter content,
                texture, and initial water content. Soils were collected manually
                using a copper ring pounded to a depth of 2 cm. Soils for nutrient
                determination were kept in a cooler until extraction, which was
                performed within 24 h of sample collection. Available nutrient
                content of soils was determined by extraction of soil in 2 M KCl by
                vigorous shaking for 1 h. Resulting extracts were filtered through
                pre-leached, ashless Whatman 42 filter papers and frozen until
                analysis for NH4+-N (phenol-hypochlorite method) and NO3--N (cadmium
                reduction method) on a Lachat flow-injection autoanalyzer. Soil
                moisture was determined gravimetrically by drying subsamples at
                105oC for 48 hours. Organic matter content was determined as
                ash-free dry mass by combustion of subsamples at 550oC for 4 h. The
                density hydrometer method was used to determine soil texture
                following dispersion of clay in sodium hexametaphosphate (Robertson
                et al. 1998). Sand content was determined gravimetrically by rinsing
                subsamples through a 53-micro meter sieve. All analyses of soils
                were conducted on the less than 2-mm fraction.
            </para>
            <para>
                            Experimental wetting treatments were applied to each of
                16 replicate plots with eight plots established at each of the two
                study sites. Plots were randomly stratified to account for spatial
                heterogeneity in soil characteristics of the sites and were located
                ~10 m to 200 m from the stream. In 2005, plots received only a
                precipitation treatment. A 1-cm precipitation event was simulated by
                applying water to 1-m2 plots using a watering can. In 2005, event
                water was synthesized to match regional precipitation chemistry and
                contained 1.5 mg N or C/L as NO3-, NH4+, and DOC (T.K. Harms,
                unpublished data and J. Koch, personal communication). In 2007, each
                (size?) plot was divided into two sub-plots, with one sub-plot
                receiving a precipitation treatment and the other a flood treatment.
                To facilitate application of simulated floods, water applied to
                plots in 2007 was collected from the stream. Water applied to plots
                in the dry season contained 0.06 mg/L NO3--N, 0.02 mg/L NH4+-N, and
                1 mg/L DOC. In the monsoon season, water contained 0.05 mg/L NO3--N,
                0.03 mg/L NH4+-N, and 2 mg/L DOC. Precipitation events (1 cm) were
                applied to 0.5-m2 plots and flood events (20 cm) were applied within
                the base of chambers used for gas sampling (0.14 m2; described
                below). C and N in experimental event water constituted a small
                fraction of the N and organic matter contained in the
                soils.
            </para>
            <para>
                            Gas and soil samples were collected from each sub-plot
                prior to application of treatments and minimally at 0.5 and 24 h
                following treatment (dry-season flood treatment). Other experiments
                were additionally monitored at 2, 4, and/or 48 h. Soil samples were
                collected from the treated area as previously described following
                the conclusion of gas sampling at each time interval using a 5-cm
                diameter core, stored in air-tight plastic bags, and analyzed for
                water content in the laboratory
            </para>
            <para>
                            In 2007, redox potential was measured in soils following
                gas collection. Probes were constructed of a platinum electrode and
                copper wire soldered to a brass rod. The Pt-brass junction was
                insulated with marine-grade epoxy and heat-shrink tubing. Electrodes
                were checked for accuracy and precision in the laboratory using
                Light solution and water, respectively (Wafer et al. 2004). Pt
                electrodes were inserted 2 cm into the soil at a 45o angle. Salt
                bridges constructed of perforated PVC filled with 2M KCl in agar
                were used to ensure electrical connection with soil. For each
                measurement, 2M KCl solution was added to the salt bridge and a
                Calomel reference electrode was placed in contact with the agar and
                the reference and Pt electrodes were connected to a current meter.
                Field measurements were corrected to the standard H2 electrode by
                adding 250 mV to each measurement
            </para>
            <para>
                            Emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O were measured using static
                chambers. All chambers were attached to bases driven into the soil
                at least 2 h prior to sampling to minimize disturbance effects.
                Insulated stainless steel chambers were attached to stainless steel
                bases, with vacuum grease applied to weatherstripping at the
                chamber-base junction to provide a gas-tight seal. Total chamber
                volume was approximately 20 L. Chambers were incubated for 45
                minutes, with gas samples withdrawn every 15 minutes. A 20 mL sample
                was collected into a nylon syringe via a septum in the chamber lid
                and air returned to the headspace passively via a vent. Headspace
                gas samples were immediately transferred to evacuated 10-mL vials
                that had been flushed with N2. Certified samples were similarly
                collected and transported to the field site to check for sample
                preservation. Air and soil temperature were obtained during chamber
                incubations. Trace gas concentrations were measured on a Varian
                CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity,
                electron capture, and flame-ionization detectors for analysis of
                CO2, N2O, and CH4, respectively. Instrument precision was greater
                than 2%. Gas flux was determined as the linear change in headspace
                concentration over time.
            </para>
            <para>
                            A relatively long incubation time was necessary for
                accurate determination of N2O and CH4 as these gases occur in low
                concentrations. Such long incubations of static chambers result in
                underestimation of CO2 flux. Although all incubations produced
                linear changes in CO2 concentration within the chamber headspace, a
                decreasing concentration gradient between the soil air and chamber
                headspace results in reduced flux of CO2 across the soil-air
                interface (Norman et al. 1997, Pumpanen et al. 2004). With the
                incubation time used here, CO2 flux is underestimated by
                approximately 4 times compared to dynamic methods (T.K. Harms,
                unpublished data). Caution should be applied toward comparison of
                these values with those collected via alternate methods. Patterns in
                CO2 flux following experimental wetting reported here were
                qualitatively similar to patterns measured using infrared gas
                analyzer to measure fluxes following experimental precipitation in
                2005.

            <para>
                            The study was conducted within the upper basin (catchment
                area ~7,600 km2) of the San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona, USA
                (Fig. 1). The upper basin is drained by an unregulated stream
                located near the Sonoran-Chihuahuan desert transition. The study
                sites lie at approximately 1200 m elevation and average annual
                precipitation in the basin ranges 300 to 750 mm, largely confined to
                two distinct seasons: winter rains (December-March) and summer
                monsoon storms (July-September). Weather preceding the monsoon
                storms is hot and dry (May-July). Two reaches were selected that are
                bordered by wide (&gt;100-300 m) floodplains and contrast in
                hydrologic characteristics. The stream at the xeric site is
                characterized by losing hydrology and at the mesic site by gaining
                hydrology (Baillie et al. 2007; Pool and Coes 1999). Because stream
                channels of losing reaches are higher in elevation than the regional
                groundwater table, water discharges from the stream to the aquifer.
                The xeric site is thus characterized by ephemeral discharge and dry
                periods occur in summer prior to onset of floods during the monsoon
                season, whereas the stream at the mesic site is perennial.
                Recurrence interval of discharges capable of inundating the entire
                floodplain at the xeric site is on the order of years, whereas
                multiple floods inundate the mesic floodplain each year. During the
                period of this study, overbank floods did not inundate the entire
                floodplain at the xeric site. At the xeric site, median discharge
                was 0 m3/s during the dry season and 1.95 m3/s in the monsoon season
                (USGS gage # 09471550, ~7 km downstream of the study site). At the
                mesic site, median discharge was 0.04 m3/s during the dry season and
                2.46 m3/s in the monsoon season (USGS gage # 09471000, ~10.5 km
                downstream from the study site).
            </para>
            <para>
                            Both floodplains are bounded by a mesquite (Prosopis
                velutina)-dominated terrace situated 3-5 m above the riparian zone.
                Vegetative communities of the floodplains are dominated by
                cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and mesquite trees, seepwillow shrubs
                (Baccharis salicifolia and B. emoryi), native bunchgrass (Sporobolus
                wrightii), and Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense), a non-native
                grass. The xeric site also contains rabbitbrush (Ericameria
                nauseosa), a perennial shrub. Compared to the mesic site, the xeric
                site supports sparse vegetation cover with fewer cottonwood trees,
                and obligate wetland species (e.g., seepwillow) are confined to
                nearstream locations. Surface elevation of the xeric floodplain is
                undulating whereas elevation increases gradually away from the
                stream at the mesic site (Fig. 2). However, absolute change in
                topography is similar between the two sites.

                            We established one 20 m x 100 m study plot along each
                reach. Plots were located adjacent and perpendicular to the active
                channel, extending 100 m into the riparian floodplain (Fig. 1). To
                facilitate geostatistical analysis, a regular grid was overlain with
                random points to yield 175 sampling locations per reach. The regular
                grid was spaced at 5 m intervals on the axis parallel to the stream,
                and random points were established at a density of 1 point/25 m2.
                Spacing of the regular grid was chosen to reflect average spacing of
                perennial trees and shrubs. Soils were sampled twice at each point,
                once during the dry season and once during the monsoon
                season.
            </para>
            <para>
                            Analysis of soils included available inorganic N,
                moisture, organic matter, texture, and potential rate of
                denitrification. Soil inorganic N was estimated as the
                ion-exchangeable fraction. Resin bags were constructed of 4 g
                mixed-bed ion-exchange resin enclosed in a nylon bag. In May 2006 we
                buried two replicate resin bags to 5 cm depth at each sampling
                point. Following 30 days of incubation, we retrieved the resin bags
                to individual plastic bags and collected one soil sample from each
                point. Soils were collected manually from within a copper ring (8 cm
                diameter) inserted to 8 cm depth. Soils and resin bags were
                transported on ice to the laboratory. Resin bags were then frozen
                until extraction. Soils were analyzed for moisture and organic
                matter content, texture, and potential rate of denitrification.
                Except for texture, these analyses were completed within 3 days of
                collection. Resin bags were again deployed during the monsoon
                season. Bags were deployed at the mesic site in August and two weeks
                later at the xeric site. Floods prevented access to the xeric site
                until this date. Floods again prevented access to both sites until
                mid-September when resin bags and soil samples were collected.
                Deposition of sediment at the mesic site resulted in significant
                loss of resin bags during the monsoon season (~60%).

                            Mass of nutrients adsorbed to resins was measured by
                extraction of resins in 2 M KCl with vigorous shaking for 1 h.
                Resulting extracts were filtered through pre-leached, ashless
                Whatman 42 filter papers and frozen until analysis for NH4+-N
                (phenol-hypochlorite method) and NO3--N (cadmium reduction method)
                on a Lachat flow-injection autoanalyzer. Analyses of bulk soil were
                conducted on the less than 2mm fraction. Soil moisture was
                determined gravimetrically by drying subsamples at 105oC for 48
                hours. Organic matter content was determined as ash-free dry mass by
                combustion of subsamples at 550oC for 4 h. The density hydrometer
                method was used to determine soil texture following dispersion of
                clay in sodium hexametaphosphate (Robertson et al. 1999)and sand
                content was determined gravimetrically by rinsing subsamples through
                a 53-&#956;m sieve. Soil texture was analyzed only during the dry
                season.

                            Potential rate of denitrification was assayed using the
                acetylene-block technique (Yoshinari et al. 1977). Soils were
                amended with a solution of dextrose (100 mg dextrose-C L-1) and
                nitrate (100 mg NO3--N L-1). Chloramphenicol (10 mg L-1) was added
                to prevent new protein synthesis. Resulting slurries were made
                anoxic by addition of N2 and acetylene was added to approximately
                10% v/v headspace. Bottles were then vented to bring headspace equal
                to atmospheric pressure, shaken manually until all particles were
                suspended, and initial headspace gas samples were collected into
                evacuated vials. A final headspace sample was collected after 4
                hours of incubation, again following vigorous shaking. Resulting gas
                samples were analyzed for N2O on a gas chromatograph equipped with
                an electron-capture detector and Porapak-Q columns.
                Temperature-specific Bunsen coefficients were used to account for
                N2O in the aqueous portion of slurries.

                            Field sampling was conducted in the upper basin of the
                San Pedro River, AZ, USA (~7,600 km2), an unregulated, perennially
                flowing river near the Sonoran-Chihuahuan desert transition. The
                study site lies at approximately 1300 m elevation and receives 300
                to 750 mm of precipitation annually, largely confined to two
                distinct seasons: winter rains (December-March) and summer monsoon
                storms (July-September). Streamwater samples were collected from a
                hydrologically gaining reach (Pool and Coes 1999, Baillie et al.
                2007) and soil and shallow groundwater were collected from the
                adjacent floodplain. The floodplain as well as spatial and temporal
                patterns in riparian soil characteristics are described in detail in
                Harms and Grimm (2008).

                            Surface water samples were collected March 2001 to
                September 2007 at various time intervals (Fig. 1). Shallow
                groundwater was collected on a subset of these dates. The dataset
                adequately captures seasonal patterns and although it contains some
                observations following storms, event-based sampling was not the
                focus of data collection. Surface water samples were collected in
                triplicate at each of two locations on the stream bordering the
                floodplain. Means of values for the two locations for each date were
                used in statistical analyses. Shallow groundwater was collected from
                6 wells March 2001 through February 2003, and from an additional 3-5
                wells March 2003 through September 2006. Median values across all
                wells sampled on each date were used in statistical analyses. Wells
                were constructed of 5 cm (inner diameter) polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
                with 1-m screened sections in the zone of saturation and unscreened
                sections in the vadose zone. The interspace between the PVC and soil
                was filled with sand, followed by native substrate, and a bentonite
                seal at the surface. Triplicate groundwater samples were collected
                by pumping for 1-2 minutes using a peristaltic pump, enough time to
                purge standing water within the well before sample bottles were
                rinsed and samples collected. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was measured
                using an YSI-85 portable field probe in water that was continuously
                pumped from the well.

                            Water samples were transported to the laboratory on ice
                and, within 24 h of collection, samples were centrifuged or
                vacuum-filtered through ashed, stacked Whatman&#174; GF/D and GF/F
                filters (nominal pore sizes 1 &#181;m and 0.7 &#181;m, respectively).
                Centrifuged samples were analyzed within 3 d of collection for
                nitrate (NO3--N; cadmium reduction method), ammonium (NH4+-N;
                phenolate method), chloride (Cl-; mercuric thiocyanate method), and
                soluble reactive phosphate (SRP; ascorbic acid method) on a Lachat
                flow-injection autoanalyzer. Filtered samples were analyzed for
                dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on a Shimadzu TOC-5000 or a Shimadzu
                TOC-VC/TN total organic carbon/nitrogen analyzer within 7 d of
                collection and total dissolved N on a Lachat autoanalyzer (inline
                persulfate-UV digestion followed by cadmium reduction) or on a
                Shimadzu TOC-VC/TN (chemiluminescence method) within 30 d of
                collection. Dissolved organic N (DON) was calculated as the
                difference between total dissolved N and the sum of NO3--N and
                NH4+-N. In our analyses, we also considered molar ratios of NO3-:
                NH4+, NO3-:SRP, DOC:DON, and DON:TN.

                            Soil samples were collected February 2003 to September
                2005 on a subset of the same dates as groundwater sampling. Soils
                were collected +1 m from each well. We analyzed extractable and
                microbial pools of C and N, and rates of microbial N
                transformations. We collected soils from the surface (after removing
                unconsolidated litter) and from the region of seasonal saturation
                (RoSS; sensu Baker et al. 2000) using an auger (17 cm x 8 cm
                diameter). The location of the RoSS varied from 60 to 180 cm depth
                among sampling locations and was estimated from a previously
                collected year-long dataset of seasonal water-table elevations for a
                subset of the groundwater wells. These data showed that water table
                elevation varied on average 40 cm annually, creating a seasonally
                inundated region during the summer monsoon and winter rains (J.D.
                Schade and D.B. Lewis, unpublished data).

                            Soils were transported on ice to the laboratory and were
                processed within 24 h of collection. Samples were passed through a
                2-mm sieve to remove the coarse fraction and large roots. Soil water
                content was determined as mass loss after drying subsamples at 105oC
                for 48 h and soil organic matter (SOM) content was determined as
                mass loss on ignition at 550oC for 4 h. Soil NO3- and NH4+
                concentrations were determined by extracting a subsample with 2M KCl
                by shaking for 1 h. Soil particles were removed from the extract by
                gravity filtration through pre-leached, ashless Whatman&#174; 42 paper
                filters. Samples were frozen until analysis on a Braunn+Luebbe
                TrAAcs autoanalyzer or a Lachat QuickChem 8000 autoanalyzer using
                the cadmium-reduction method for NO3- and the phenolate method for
                NH4+. We determined net N-mineralization and nitrification rates by
                incubating a subsample at room temperature in the dark for ~28 d,
                with soil water adjusted to fresh content weekly. Rates were
                determined by the difference of pre- and post- incubation
                extractable NH4+ and NO3-, respectively (Robertson et al. 1999). We
                estimated microbial biomass C and N as the difference in extractable
                DOC and TN between a pre-fumigation and chloroform-fumigated
                subsample (Robertson et al. 1999). Soils were fumigated in the dark
                under a chloroform atmosphere for 3 d followed by extraction in 0.5M
                K2SO4. Samples were frozen until analysis for dissolved organic
                carbon (DOC) and total dissolved N as described for water samples.
                During periods of low soil water content, this method can yield
                negative biomass values. We set all negative microbial biomass
                values to 0 for analysis.
