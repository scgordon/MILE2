The Data User will not redistribute the original Data Set beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Data Set in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Data Set. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. For example: McKee, W. 2001. Vascular plant list on the Andrews Experimental Forest and nearby Research Natural Areas: Long-Term Ecological Research. Corvallis, OR: Forest Science Data Bank: SA002. [Database]. http://www.fsl.orst.edu/lter/data/abstract.cfm?dbcode=SA002. (21 October 2004) 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Data Set contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. For example: Data sets were provided by the Forest Science Data Bank, a partnership between the Department of Forest Science, Oregon State University, and the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Corvallis, Oregon. Significant funding for collection of these data was provided by the National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research program (NSF Grant numbers BSR-90-11663 and DEB-96-32921). 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Data Set Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Data Set is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Data Set and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Data Set was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Data Set has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Data Set Creator. By accepting this Data Set, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms.

        <geographicDescription>The Bonney meteorology station is located at a latitude of -77.714443, a longitude of 162.46415, and an elevation of 64.43 meters above sea level.The station is located on shore of East Lobe of Lake BonneyID: BOYM History : The Lake Bonney meteorology station was initially built on the lake's ice cover in November, 1993. Shortly thereafter the station was listed to the point where it was decided to move it to shore. Some attempt was made to right the station during this period. The move of the station was done using the ATV with the station still running. The move began at 14:50 and ended at 15:06 on December 17, 1993. Data collected after 15:06 was done so with the station in it's final position. The clock synchronized with John Priscu's logger measuring light on Nov 26 in afternoon. The station was set up to sample sensors every 30 seconds and send summary statistics (for example, averages and maximums) to solid-state storage modules every: 10 minutes from November 24, 1993 to January 12, 1994, three hours from January 12, 1994 to November 12, 1994, 20 minutes from November 12, 1994 to November 22, 1995 15 minutes thereafter. This has resulted in approximately 28 values being recorded for final storage in every output interval.</geographicDescription>
