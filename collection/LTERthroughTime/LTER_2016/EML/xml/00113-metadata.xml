    <abstract>
      <para>The project is aimed at explaining the spatial and temporal variation in stream water chemistry at the headwater 
				catchment scale using a framework based on the combined study of hydrology and soil development &#8211; hydropedology.  
				The project will demonstrate how hydrology strongly influences soil development and soil chemistry, and in turn, 
				controls stream water quality in headwater catchments.  Understanding the linkages between hydrology and soil 
				development can provide valuable information for managing forests and stream water quality.  Feedbacks between soils 
				and hydrology that lead to predictable landscape patterns of soil chemistry have implications for understanding spatial 
				gradients in site productivity and suitability for species with differing habitat requirements or chemical sensitivity.  Tools are needed that identify and predict these gradients that can ultimately provide guidance for land management and silvicultural decision making.  Better integration between soil science, hydrology, and biogeochemistry will provide the conceptual leap needed by the hydrologic community to be able to better predict and explain temporal and spatial variability of stream water quality and understand water sources contributing to streamflow.</para>

            <title>SAMPLING DESIGN</title>
            <para>This network of wells was designed to monitor water table dynamics across different soil units throughout 
							Watershed 3. At each well, a small soil pit was hand excavated to ~10 cm into the C horizon 
							(40 to 100 cm; 65 cm average) and pedogenic horizons were described.   Each soil profile was assigned a soil
							type based on horizon presence and thickness. Wells were constructed of standard dimension ratio (SDR) 21 
							PVC pipe with a 3.76 cm inner diameter and a 31 cm screen length consisting of 0.025 cm width lateral slots 
							with 0.32 cm spacing between slots.  Wells were either installed with a 10 cm hand auger immediately upslope
							of the characterization pit or in the backfilled pit.  The auger was used to bore 10 cm into the C horizon 
							so that the base of the well screen was inserted into the C horizon. Wells were installed on top of bedrock 
							in the cases where a C horizon was not present.  Local washed sand was used to backfill to a depth just 
							above the screened interval, and then native soil was backfilled and carefully compacted above the screened 
							interval to the soil surface.

          <section>
            <title>DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES</title>
            <para>Each well was equipped with a 1.5 m Odyssey Water Level Logger that used 
							capacitance measured along a Teflon coated wire suspended in the well to determine water level 
							(Dataflow Systems Pty Ltd) recorded at 10 minute intervals.

          </section>
          <section>
            <title>CALCULATIONS</title>
            <para>To get depth of water table below the surface, substract the Pipe Height from the location and pipe height dataset. 
						Readings that were not due to natural variations in water table were
						removed from the data record. For example: If a well was pumped for a
						sample, the water table recordings while the well recovered were removed.
						The other most common reason for removal was that the instrument was pulled from
						the well to download data, resulting in one or two data points that
						reflected the water level recorder being out of the well.
