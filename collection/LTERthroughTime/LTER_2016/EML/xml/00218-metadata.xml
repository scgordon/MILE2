    <abstract>A whole-tree harvest was conducted during the dormant season of 1983-1984 in order to assess ecosystem response to whole-tree logging operations. Pre-harvest forest inventory surveys were conducted in 1982 on the whole of the watershed. 
			Post-harvest surveys were conducted in 1990, 1994 and every 5 years thereafter. This dataset was collected in summer of 2004. Survey methods differed between years due to the variability encountered in the aggrading forest.</abstract>

            <title>SAMPLING BACKGROUND</title>
            <para>The watershed was surveyed in 1982
							and clearcut in winter of 1983 - 1984. Post-cut tree surveys were
							initiated in 1990 and repeated in 1994, 1999 and at 5 year intervals after that.
							These data were collected in the summer of 2004.
							The hydrology has been monitored since 1962 and 
							stream water chemistry monitored since
							1963. In 1982, before the clearcut, the
							watershed was forested by typical northern
							hardwood species (sugar maple, beech and yellow
							birch) on the lower 85 % of its area and by a
							montane boreal transition forest of red spruce,
							balsam fir and white birch on the highest 15%.
							Surveying techniques were used in 1982 to
							install a grid system of 360 grid units, each 25
							x 25-m square. These grid units serve as the
							plot system. See the following webpages for more information:</para>

            <title>DATA DESCRIPTION</title>
            <para>The data consist of the diameters
							(dbh) of all trees &gt;=1.5cm dbh, live and
							dead, on a 1 x 25 m plot within each of 101 25 x
							25 m grid units. (4373 individual stems). Dead
							trees were recorded as standing dead trees
							(trees dead but retaining most of their fine
							branches) and as snags (trees broken off above
							dbh or with only their major large branches
							still intact). Live trees were noted "sick" if
							they had very sparse foliage or yellowing
							foliage in the mid summer sampling. All stems
							that met the size criteria were measured
							individually, and in some years it was noted
							whether a stem was part of a group of stems from
							the same tree (i.e. multiple stems that split
							from a single trunk below breast height). For
							W5, whether or not a stem was part of a group
							was recorded in all post-harvest survey years.

          <section>
            <title>CALCULATIONS</title>
            <para>Aboveground and belowground biomass
							was estimated for each stem in the inventory and
							is included in the data. Estimates were based on
							species-specific allometric equations developed
							at Hubbard Brook. See "How do we quantify a
							forest?" for details. Phytosociology or biomass
							summaries can be obtained by using our
							interactive calculators. Phytosociology
							summaries include basal area, density and
							frequency of each species for the watershed as a
							whole or for smaller units as chosen by the
							user. Diameter distributions for a specific
							species can also be selected. Biomass summaries
							include biomass estimates by plant part for each
							species for the watershed as a whole or for
							smaller units as chosen by the user. Options to
							estimate productivity and total nutrient pools
							in the vegetation are also available.
