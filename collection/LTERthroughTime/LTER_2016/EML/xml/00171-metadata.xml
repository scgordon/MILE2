        <para>
          <literalLayout>As part of a collaborative investigation between researchers at Rice University, Arkansas State University, University of Rochester, and Ohio State University, lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys were sampled at discreet depth intervals during the 2005-2006 field season. &#194;&#160;Sample splits were subsequently analyzed for chemical and isotopic composition of both gases and dissolved &#194;&#160;ions, as well as dissolved organic carbon. In addition, cryogenic salts were sampled in the surrounding lake shores in order to determine the salt sources. Gravity cores were also obtained and in the case of Lake Vanda, a white precipitate was recovered from the lake bottom. &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;&#194;&#160; Presented &#194;&#160;in this file is the mineralogic composition of salt crusts that were collected on the surface of sediment and rocks surrounding the lakes, as well as the lake-bottom precipitate from Lake Vanda. &#194;&#160;The results are based on low-temperature XRD determinations, and Rietveld refinement of whole peaks. &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;</literalLayout>

        <geographicDescription>Don Juan Pond is located in the west end of the Wright Valley. It is wedged between the Asgard Range and the Dias. On the west end there is a small tributary and a feature that has been described as a rock glacier. Don Juan Pond is a shallow (i.e. flat bottom) hyper-saline pond. The salinity is high enough that it doesn't freeze even in winter. Therefore, unlike other lakes and ponds in the dry valleys, it has no ice cover. It has been described as a groundwater discharge zone. The dominant ions in solution are calcium and chloride. The area around Don Juan Pond is covered with sodium chloride and calcium chloride salts that have been precipitated as the water evaporated. Area and volume of Don Juan Pond varies over time. According to the USGS topo map published in 1977, the area was approximately 0.25 sq. km. However, in recent years the size of the pond has shrunk considerably. The pond has changed over the past 5 years although this is mostly anecdotal. The maximum depth in 93-94 was described as "a foot deep." In Jan 97, it was approximately 10cm deep; in Dec 98 the pond was almost dry everywhere except for an area 10's of sq meters. Most of the water that was left was restricted to depressions around large boulders in the pond.

        <geographicDescription>The Lake Fryxell basin is formed by a moraine depression in a wider portion of the Taylor Valley. It has a number of moraine islands and shallower areas, as well as several relatively well developed deltas. The lake is fed by at least 10 meltwater streams with a total drainage catchment of 230 km2. The lake is dammed to the southwest by the Canada Glacier and is topographically closed. It is perennially ice covered; during summer months, an ice-free moat generally forms around much of the lake margin. Lake levels have risen ~2 m between 1971 and 1996. There are no surface outflows; the only known water loss is through ice ablation (evaporation, sublimation and physical scouring).

        <geographicDescription>Lake Hoare occupies a narrower portion of the Taylor Valley, dammed by the Canada Glacier. It would drain almost completely without this dam. There are a number of islands which may be related to an old terminal of Canada Glacier. The lake is fed primarily from direct runoff from the glacier, as well as meltwater streams. (Lake level rose ~1.5 m between 1972 and 1996). There are no surface outflows; the only known water loss is through ice ablation (evaporation, sublimation and physical scouring).

              <literalLayout>&#194;&#160;Salts were collected in the areas surrounding the Dry Valley lakes. The samples were bagged and then placed either in boxes or in plastic containers in order to avoid crushing them. The samples were stored in a freezer at -40 C, prior to shipping, due to the instability of Antarcticite at room temperatures. The samples were then shipped under dry ice to Rice University in Houston, then shipped to the Steacie Institute for Molecular Sciences &#194;&#160;in Ottawa, which is a division of the Canadian Research Council. &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;&#194;&#160; Hailong Lu, a research scientist in the Institute whose specialty is on the structure of marine gas hydrates, placed each sample in a mortar with liquid nitrogen and then ground it into a powder. The powders were then analyzed with a low-temperature XRD. Temperatures were first dropped to -140 C, then gradually &#194;&#160;ramped up to room temperature to look at phase changes that occurred on warming. Minerals were identified JADE 8.5 data processing software, and the ICDD PDF-2 Data Base. The relative abundance of each crygenic mineral was dertermined by the Rietveld method of whole-peak fitting. &#194;&#160;</literalLayout>
