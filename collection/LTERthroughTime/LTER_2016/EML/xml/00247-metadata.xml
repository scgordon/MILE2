    <abstract>
      <para>In 1990-1991 segments of boles from felled sugar maple (Acer saccharum), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis)
				and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) trees were placed in the field to study the rate of decomposition 
				and nutrient loss (or gain) over time. The segments incubated in the field, ranging from 0.5-1.3 meters in 
				length, were paired with fresh segments from the same trees. The fresh segments were taken to the lab shortly 
				after felling, dried, weighed and subsampled. Fresh samples of wood and bark were collected separately.
				
				Incubated bole segments were collected in 1993, 1997, 2001, 2007 and 2015. The whole bole segments were 
				transported to the lab, measured, dried and weighed to determine mass loss. Subsamples of the bole wood 
				and bark were collected for chemical analysis, including C, N, H, Ca, Mg, K, Si, Al, Pb, Zn, Mn and Fe. 
				Chemical analyses were conducted concurrently on the fresh and incubated samples. This data set includes 
				the masses of the fresh and incubated boles along with the concentrations of the chemical analytes. 
				Element pools in the boles can be calculated by multiplying the concentrations by the mass values.
				
				This data set includes chemical data for samples collected in 1993, 2001, and 2007 and their paired fresh 
				samples. Samples from 1997 were measured for mass, but inadvertently discarded prior to chemical analysis. 
				Chemical measurements of samples collected in 2015 are still in progress, and will be added at a later time.</para>

            <title>SAMPLING DESIGN</title>
            <para>This study was performed at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in central New 
							Hampshire, USA.  Most of the HBEF is northern hardwood forest, dominated 
							by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), American beech (Fagus grandifolia Erhr.), and yellow 
							birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.). Together, these three species accounted for 86% of the 
							above-ground living tree biomass in a similarly situated stand at the HBEF when this study was 
							initiated in 1991 (Siccama et al. 2007). This work was conducted in the area of the south-facing 
							experimental watersheds 1-6 at the HBEF. 
							In July 1990 and May 1991, 71 trees of the three dominant species were felled with a chain saw. 
							The trees were approximately 50-70 years old. From each felled tree, two adjacent segments of 
							the bole, each approximately 1.5-m long (range: 0.99 &#8211; 2.22 m), were isolated with a chain saw. 
							After measuring the length and the diameter at each end, one of these segments was then placed 
							on the forest floor under fully intact forest canopy. The incubated bole segments were placed 
							on sloping ground, approximately perpendicular to contours, in two similar stands approximately
							200 m apart. The other &#8216;fresh&#8217; segment was taken to the lab for sampling. Each of the 71 
							samples incubated in situ was therefore paired with a fresh sample from the same tree.</para>
          </section>
          <section>
            <title>INITIAL LABORATORY WORK</title>
            <para> After measuring the dimensions of the fresh bole-segments, disks about 8-10 cm thick were cut from one end of 
							each segment.  The bark was separated from the wood of each disk, and both were dried at 80o C to constant weight.   
							Subsamples were collected from the fresh wood disks by drilling from the side to the center with a 2.5-cm drill bit.  
							The dried bark samples and the wood shavings were ground in a Wiley mill.  Subsamples from the same log were 
							composited for chemical analysis.</para>
          </section>
          <section>
            <title>FIELD COLLECTION PROCEDURES</title>
            <para>Incubated boles were collected from the field in April, 1993 (2Y); May, 1997 (6Y); May-July, 2001 (10Y); and July, 
							2007 (16Y). Three boles of each species (nine total) were collected in 1993, 1997 and 2001.  In 2007, three beech, 
							six maple and six birch boles were collected. After removing any surface litter the bole was gently rolled onto a 
							sampling tarp, and any loose material was collected in a bag. The log was placed in the bag and returned to the 
							laboratory for processing.</para>
          </section>
          <section>
            <title>POST-INCUBATION SAMPLE PREPARATION</title>
            <para>The incubated boles were dried at 80 oC to constant weight, which was recorded.  The dry boles were laid out on kraft paper, along with the loose debris collected in the field. After measuring the dimensions of each log, we then removed the bark from the bole and gathered the bark fragments from the debris. The mass of the bark and the wood (log+loose debris) was recorded.  Subsamples of the log were collected by drilling to the center of the log with a 2.5-cm bit. Log, loose debris, and bark samples were ground in a Wiley mill for chemical analysis. A wood sample for chemical analysis was created by mixing loose debris and log samples proportionally by mass.  
							Two beech boles collected in 2001 (10Y) had so little bark remaining that it was not sampled and judged to be completely decomposed. The samples collected in 1997 (6Y) were inadvertently discarded after mass determination, so we have no chemical data for those samples. In total, 42 incubated boles have been collected from the field to date. Chemical measurements have been made on 64 bark samples (33 fresh, 31 decomposed) and 66 wood samples (33 fresh, 33 decomposed). 
							</para>
          </section>
          <section>
            <title>CHEMICAL ANALYSIS</title>
            <para>Total carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen were measured on oven-dried subsamples using a Carlo Erba EA1108 elemental analyzer. 
							Other elemental concentrations were measured on HNO3 digests of the samples. A crucible containing approximately two grams of oven-dried sample was placed in a muffle furnace (500 oC) overnight. The ash was then dissolved into 8 mL of 6 M HNO3, filtered through a Whatman #40 paper filter, and brought to a volume of 50 mL using deionized water. The concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, P, and Mn were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). All values were blank-corrected. 
							Silica was analyzed on a sodium hydroxide extract of wood and bark samples.  100 mg of sample was extracted with 40 mL of 0.5 M NaOH for 4 hours in an 85C warm water bath.  Two milliliters of extract were added to 4 mL of 0.25 M HCl.  The neutralized extract was analyzed colorimetrically for Si as SiO2.  
							</para>
          </section>
          <section>
            <title>CALCULATIONS</title>
            <para>The disks were used to calculate the initial dry masses of wood and bark for the paired sample 
										left in the field using two different calculation methods.  The density method used the density 
										calculated for these disks and the measured bark/wood mass ratio for the fresh bole were used 
										with the initial dimensions of the incubated bole to compute the initial masses of wood and bark. 
										The moisture method used the moisture calculated for these disks and the measured bark/wood mass 
										ratio to compute the mass of the in situ log. These initial log masses can be compared to the 
										incubated bole masses to determine the mass loss during decomposition.</para>
