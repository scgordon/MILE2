        <para>
          <literalLayout>In 1995, a removal study was initiated at the Sevilleta LTER to examine the response of vegetation following the removal of dominant species. Five sites were selected that were dominated by either blue grama (site 1), blue and black grama (site 2), black grama (site 3), black grama and creosote (site 4), or creosote (site 5). A sixth site was later added in the blue grama community along the foothills of the Los Pinos Mountains (site 6). At sites 1, 3, 5, and 6, five 3m x 4m plots had all plants of the dominant species removed; five 3m x 4m plots were controls. At site 2, 5 plots had blue grama removed, 5 plots had black grama removed, and 5 plots were controls. At site 4, 5 plots had black grama removed, 5 plots had creosote removed, and 5 plots were controls. Initial cover prior to removal was estimated by species for each plot. Grass was removed using a shovel to collect above-ground biomass and crowns just below the soil surface. Shrubs were removed using large clippers to collect above-ground biomass to the soil surface. All biomass removed was bagged, dried, and weighed. Plot maintenance or removal of the target dominant species is performed annually or as needed. Rain gauges were installed at each site and the corners of the areas containing each set of plots GPS'd. Plot corners are marked by nails and are flagged periodically to aid identification and minimize foot traffic in the plots. Each northeast nail has a metal tag with site and plot number on it. Erosion bridges (1 m long) were installed in plots 1, 3 and 5 (removals and controls) at sites 1-5. Initial measurements were made in 1996.</literalLayout>

        <geographicDescription>Deep Well is located on McKenzie Flats and is site of the longest running SEV LTER met station, number 40, which has been active since 1988.&#160; In addition to studies of meteorological variables, core line-intercept vegetation transects and line-intercept transects from the 1995 &amp; 2001 Deep Well fires are sampled here.&#160; The mini-rhizotron study, blue and black grama compositional comparison, blue and black grama patch dynamics investigation, and kangaroo rat population assessement are all ongoing here.&#160; Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is also the location of the warming and monsoon experiments, as well as portions of the line-intercept and vegetation removal studies. On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the area of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed.&#160; While portions of this site were burned, the entirety was not.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the fire.</geographicDescription>

            <para>
              <literalLayout>Collecting the Data: Each fall, during peak biomass (late Aug.-early Oct.), species richness and cover are visually observed in each plot. Data are entered onto a palmtop using the pre-formatted spreadsheet for ease of entry and transfer to a PC. The procedure is as follows: 1. Locate the metal tag on the northeastern nail and enter the site and plot code into the palmtop. 2. Depending on the treatment, certain species may need to be removed in and around the plot. The removal codes are as follows: RU-Remove BOGR2, RA-Remove BOER4, and RC-Remove LATR2. Do not remove plants from the control (C) and total removal (TR) plots. 3. Thoroughly search each plot and record every species present. This is ideally done by 1-2 people, but a single observer is sufficient. 4. The percent canopy cover of each species in the plot is estimated visually using the following numerical ranges: T = &amp;lt; 0.1% 0.1-0.9% by intervals of 0.1% 1-5% by intervals of 0.5% 5-20% by intervals of 1.0% 20-100% by intervals of 5.0% Cover is estimated for all species as well as litter. Bare ground is calculated by subtracting the total cover of all species from 100%. Cover of less than 0.1% is recorded in the data as "T" (i.e., trace). It is advisable to re-flag plot corners and perform plot maintenance prior to assessing cover. To maintain the plots, clip any species to be removed from the edges and middle of the plot. Do not re-clip anything from the total removal plots. Laboratory procedures: Biomass removed from plots is dried, sorted by live and dead material, and weighed. Data description: In some years, dates of data collection were lost. -999 has been entered for "Date" in such instances. Also, in 1996, data was collected in both the summer and fall. Therefore, the 1996 data represents the maximum cover of a species observed that year, regardless of sampling period.</literalLayout>
