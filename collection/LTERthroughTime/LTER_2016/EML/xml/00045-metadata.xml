        <para>
          <literalLayout>On September 9, 1999, the data manager added the 1998-1999 data to this dataset. In the process,at the &#194;&#160;request of Thomas Nylen, she did some fine-tuning of the data. Revisions included: &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;1. Removal and flagging of WDir and WDirStd values on Nov 25, 1994 @ 9:20. Since windspeed was zero (0), &#194;&#160;it made no sense to have values for wind direction. &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;2. Addition of PAR values between Dec 30, 1994 @ 17:00 and Jan 20, 1995 @ 15:00. &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;On June 1, 2000, the 1999-2000 data was posted. In the process, Denise Steigerwald changed thelayout of &#194;&#160;the files so that they were sorted by category (air temperatures, humidity, radiation,wind etc.) rather than by year. &#194;&#160;Files containing monthly and daily averages were generated andminor adjustments were made to the metadata. &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;On June 1, 2000, relative humidity (RH) values were corrected for a systematic error in themeasurement created &#194;&#160;by an instrument manufacturer error. All RH data with air temperaturesbelow freezing were corrected using the vapor pressure over ice (rather than over water which was used initially). The error became quite large for very &#194;&#160;cold temperatures (the correction could grow to around 30%). The formula used for the correction was: &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;RH_corr=RH_orig/((A*temp*temp)+(B*temp)+C) &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;where &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;RH_corr = corrected relative humidity &#194;&#160;RH_orig = original relative humidity &#194;&#160;temp = air temperature &#194;&#160;A = 4.165E-5 &#194;&#160;B = 9.7E-3 &#194;&#160;C = 1.0 &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;For example, with an air temperature of -2.3 and RH_orig of 50.6, the RH_corr will be 51.7.Records that &#194;&#160;showed corrected RH values greater tha n or equal to 100 were changed to 99.99and flagged.&#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;In June 2000, summary files were added to the web containing daily and monthly statistics.These were &#194;&#160;generated by creating "views" of daily and monthly means, minimums, maximums and counts of the records represented in the Oracle database's meteorology tables. &#194;&#160; In 2006, metadata was offered in EML format, the specification adopted by the LTER Network. (Gradner, San Gil) &#194;&#160; In 2014, Metadata was ported to the Drupal Ecological Information Management system (DEIMS, San Gil) &#194;&#160; In 2015, derivated data (daily amdn monthly averages) was given identifiers and included formally in the MCMLTER data catalog &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;</literalLayout>

            <para>
              <literalLayout>During the 1994-1995 field season, the Lake Vanda meteorological station was constructed near the mouth of the Onyx River. The station was set up to sample sensors every 30 seconds and send summary statistics (for example, averages and maximums) to solid-state storage modules every 20 minutes between November 24, 1994 and December 30, 1994, every hour between December 30, 1994 and November 21, 1995, and every 15 minutes thereafter. This has resulted in approximately 20 values being recorded for final storage in every output interval. Station was relocated after it was blown away in 2004. &#194;&#160;Onyx River temperature (thermistor) ceased then, as seen in the data record,&#194;&#160;</literalLayout>

On January 26, 2000 (26) @ 1021, replaced 207 air temperature probe with 107 temperature probe. Air temperature went from 0.56, measured with 207, to 0.47 C, measured with 107. The shield was raised from 2.7 meters to 2.8 meters above the ground. It is the highest the shield can go without interfering with wind monitor. The bar holding the pyranometer and wind monitor was also raised 10cm. The wind monitor is now 3m from the ground surface. The roughness of the surface is 20cm. 5. The soil temperatures and Onyx temperature wires were switched around to match the specifications in the new program. Flag intervals with logger errors. 6.
