          <literalLayout>As part of the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, a systematic sampling program has been undertaken to monitor mass balance and meltwater flow from the Taylor Valley glaciers. This data includes stake height and snow depth measurements to the surface of six glaciers in Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Monitoring the changes in these measurements over time provides a record of mass balance, and aids in determining the role of glaciers in the polar hydrologic cycle.</literalLayout>

        <para>
          <literalLayout>Data for the original stake height and snow depth measurements, as well as the averages and standard deviations was submitted by Andrew G. Fountain to the data manager in August, 1997. The column showing "file name" identifies the original file containing that record. These provenance ascii text files and can be found by the data manager's office. Once submitted to INSTAAR, the data manager used Microsoft Excel and Access software to produce files that were in more of a relational mode. Information was assigned to different files according to type of data it dealt with. Separate files were generated for:&#194;&#160;* stake height replications,&#194;&#160;* snow depth replications, and&#194;&#160;* averages/standard deviations calculated from stake height and snow depth replications. In March, 2000, Thomas Nylen submitted data from the 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons. Instead of lumping all of the stake height and snow depth values for each glacier under one file, they were separated into files for each glacier. Metadata fields were also updated at this time. In April, 2000, Denise Steigerwald added fields for dataset code and glstkid. Dataset code would allow the data to be linked to the metadata in a relational database. Glstkid is a code that ties stake records to points on a GIS base map being developed by Michael Prentice at the University of New Hampshire. In addition, Denise divided the 'stake' field to 'stake' and 'stk replcmnt' values. The 'stake' value is an ID for a stake in a given location over time, while the 'stk replcmnt' value shows whether the stake is the original(A), the first replacement stake installed(B), the second stake installed(C), and so forth. (Melting on the glacier over time makes installation of replacement stakes necessary.) Since the replacement value is only relevant for the stake heights and snow depths datasets, division of the 'stake' value into separate fields made it more straightforward for grouping data across different datasets (eg. stake heights and snow densities).Metadata was shared in standardized format in 2006, prepared with the help of Chris Gardner and Inigo San Gil.In 2014, metadata was revamped and presented in a friendlier manner using the Drupal Ecological Information Management System on 2015</literalLayout>
