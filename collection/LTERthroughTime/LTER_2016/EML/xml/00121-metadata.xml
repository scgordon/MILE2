          <literalLayout>As part of the Long Term Ecological Research in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, meteorological data was collected from various locations throughout Beacon, Taylor, Wright and Victoria Valleys. These files contain data for the Friis Hills meteorology station. The station captured data first on the 2006/07 season, installed by Cuffey and others, and brought to LTER format by THomas Nylen on 2010/11 season.</literalLayout>

        <literalLayout>&#194;&#160;Meteorological data is collected year-round at each of the stations in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. After retrieving this data (usually every January), the parameters that are recorded are processed from level 0 (raw) to level 1 (processed, provided on the web). The raw data file descriptions and task lists summarize what was done to get from level 0 to level 1 for all station found at the following address: &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; http://mcmlter.lternet.edu/data/meteorology/tasks/task_lists.htm &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160; &#194;&#160;</literalLayout>
