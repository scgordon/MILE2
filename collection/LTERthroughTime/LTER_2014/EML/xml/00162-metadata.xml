   <abstract>
  <para> High resolution (6 cm pixel) RGB true color tiled air photo mosaics for Hog Island, Northampton County, VA, collected on October 11, 2011 on behalf of the USACE Engineer Research and Development Center using the Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging Lidar (CZMIL) system. CZMIL integrates a lidar sensor with topographic and bathymetric capabilities, a digital camera and a hyperspectral imager on a single remote sensing platform for use in coastal mapping and charting activities. LiDAR data is provided as a separate VCRLTER dataset. </para>
  <para>Two data entities are included here: (1) a tiled collection of air photo mosaics created from the CZMIL camera imagery (6 cm. resolution; tiles approximately 690 x 715 m. in X and Y, resp.) composed of 71 individual georeferenced TIFF files; and (2) a polygon INDEX shapefile showing the footprint of each TIFF file and containing ID information in the attribute table (column, row, and colrow matching the TIFF naming convention).</para>
  <para>Note that the two co-collected 2011 USACE datasets (LiDAR and RGB ) are in different coordinate systems: (A) the horizontal and vertical units of the LiDAR data are in US feet, not meters; and (B) the horizontal units of the associated RGB mosaic images are in [standard] meters.</para>
  <para>Also Note that THESE ARE VERY LARGE DATASETS and download should not be attempted unless you have a fast network connection and plenty of disk space. The LAS file data collection is 7.3 GB compressed (11.7 GB uncompressed). The RGB imagery mosaic data collection is 12.9 GB compressed (30.8 GB uncompressed).</para>

  <para> These data were collected using the CZMIL system. It is owned and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The system collects lidar data at 20 kHz and RGB imagery at 2 Hz. A CASI-1500 hyperspectral line scanner is integrated with the system as well. Aircraft position, velocity and acceleration information are collected through a combination of Novatel and POS A/V 510 equipment. All raw data streams are transferred to the office for downloading and processing in CZMIL&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Hydro Fusion software. Aircraft position data are processed using POSPac software and the results are combined with the lidar data to produce 3-D positions for each lidar shot. Upon inspection and QA/QC in the software packages Fledermaus and PFM_ABE, anomalous data are flagged as invalid. NOAA&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s VDatum software then converts all valid data from ellipsoid to orthometric heights based on the NGS' GEOID09 model and exports valid lidar data as a series of unclassified ascii xyz files. </para>
