          <para>SS00101: Re-classified landcover data of the McKenzie River Basin. Original data came from the Historical Vegetation 1938 map developed from the General Land Office survey by the Oregon Biodiversity Information Center (see http://www.pdx.edu/pnwlamp/glo-based-historical-mapping-in-the-pacific-northwestfor more information on the original dataset). The classes represent: 11= Open Water, 31= Bare Rock/Sand/Clay, 41= Deciduous Forest, 42= Evergreen Forest, 43= Mixed Forest, 51= Shrubland, 71= Grassland/Herbaceous, 91= Woody Wetlands, 92= Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands. There were no developed classes in the original dataset, so users of the data need to be aware that those classes are missing from the raster because of source data limitations.</para>

      <abstract>
        <para>The H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest is a living laboratory that provides unparalleled opportunities for the study of forest and stream ecosystems in the central Cascade Range of Oregon. Since 1980, as a part of the National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research (NSF-LTER) program, the Andrews Experimental Forest has become a leader in the analysis of forest and stream ecosystem dynamics.</para> 

<para>Long-term field experiments and measurement programs have focused on climate dynamics, streamflow, water quality, and vegetation succession. Currently researchers are working to develop concepts and tools needed to predict effects of natural disturbance, land use, and climate change on ecosystem structure, function, and species composition. </para>

<para>The Andrews Experimental Forest is administered cooperatively by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University and the Willamette National Forest. Funding for the research program comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and other sources.</para></abstract>

          <descriptorValue>The Andrews Forest is situated in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, and covers the entire 15,800-acre (6400-ha) drainage basin of Lookout Creek. Elevation ranges from 1350 to 5340 feet (410 to 1630 m). Broadly representative of the rugged mountainous landscape of the Pacific Northwest, the Andrews Forest contains excellent examples of the region's conifer forests and associated wildlife and stream ecosystems. These forests are among the tallest and most productive in the world, with tree heights of often greater than 250 ft (75 m). Streams are steep, cold and clean, providing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms.</descriptorValue>

      <entityDescription>McKenzie Basin 1938 Vegetation Classification for the Maps and Locals Project (MALS): Re-classified landcover data of the McKenzie River Basin. Original data came from the Historical Vegetation 1938 map developed from the General Land Office survey by the Oregon Biodiversity Information Center (see http://www.pdx.edu/pnwlamp/glo-based-historical-mapping-in-the-pacific-northwestfor more information on the original dataset). The classes represent: 11= Open Water, 31= Bare Rock/Sand/Clay, 41= Deciduous Forest, 42= Evergreen Forest, 43= Mixed Forest, 51= Shrubland, 71= Grassland/Herbaceous, 91= Woody Wetlands, 92= Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands. There were no developed classes in the original dataset, so users of the data need to be aware that those classes are missing from the raster because of source data limitations.</entityDescription>
