    <abstract>
      <para>The influence of density-dependent and number-dependent processes on individual demographic rates often results in ecological tradeoffs.  Because such processes have important implications for individual level fitness and population regulation, they long have been an important topic in ecological research.  I used <emphasis>Dascyllus trimaculatus</emphasis>, a site-attached planktivorous coral reef fish, to determine independently the effects of population density and group size on rates of individual growth and mortality.  Somatic growth of <emphasis>D. trimaculatus</emphasis> was positively related to the density of <emphasis>D. trimaculatus</emphasis> outplanted to host anenomes, <emphasis>Heteractis magnifica</emphasis>, with nearly twice as much growth observed in individuals living in the highest density treatment.  By contrast, survivorship of <emphasis>D. trimaculatus</emphasis> on <emphasis>H. magnifica</emphasis> exhibited a negative relationship with density.  There was no significant effect of group size on either the growth or mortality rates of <emphasis>D. trimaculatus</emphasis>.  These relationships suggest a tradeoff between density-dependent growth and survival in this species.</para>
      <para>My analysis of behavioral data indicated that <emphasis>D. trimaculatus</emphasis> living under conditions of higher local population densities displayed decreased rates of intraspecific aggression because of positive feedback between local population density and the foraging distance from an individual&#8217;s host anemone.  In turn, lower rates of aggression and feeding higher in the water column resulted in increased somatic growth rates due to: (1) a reduced energy expenditure and (2) an increase in prey consumption.</para>

            <title>Study site and study organism</title>
            <para>All field work was conducted during the Austral winter of 2012 on the north shore of Moorea, French Polynesia (17&#186;30&#8217; S, 149&#186;50&#8217; W) (Fig. S1).  The threespot dascyllus (<emphasis>Dascyllus trimaculatus</emphasis>) is found throughout the Indo-Pacific on coral reefs at depths up to 55 m (Allen 1991).  The species is a diurnal planktivore, foraging in the water column during the day and taking shelter at night to avoid predation (Holbrook and Schmitt 2002).  In Moorea, threespot dascyllus experience an average of two settlement peaks per lunar month (Holbrook and Schmitt 1997, Schmitt and Holbrook 1999b) when pulses of recruits settle to their host sea anemones (<emphasis>Heteractis magnifica</emphasis>) where they remain closely associated until reaching adulthood (Schmitt and Holbrook 1996, 1999a).  </para>

          <section>
            <title>Effects of density and group size on growth and survivorship</title>
            <para>We conducted a field experiment to explore effects of density and group size on growth and survivorship of newly-settled threespot dascyllus.  Host anemones of two sizes [small (200 cm2) and large (400 cm2)] were transplanted to a shallow fringing reef (Fig. S1), and small (3 fish) or large (6 fish) groups of threespot dascyllus were established on these replicate habitat units to create three densities (1) low, 0.0075 fish/cm<superscript>2</superscript>, N = 4 large anemones with 3 fish each, (2) medium, 0.015 fish/cm<superscript>2</superscript>, N = 9 small anemones with 3 fish each and N = 6 large anemones with 6 fish each, and (3) high, 0.03 fish/cm<superscript>2</superscript>, N = 3 small anemones with 6 fish each (total number of fish = 93) (Table S1).  This experimental design allowed for exploration of the effects of density across the low, medium and high density treatments, as well as assessment of effects of group size within the medium density treatment.  The group sizes and densities reflect levels found naturally on reefs in Moorea (Schmitt and Holbrook 1996).  Anemones were spaced at least 5 m apart along two parallel 50 m transects to reduce movement of focal fish among them.  SCUBA divers using hand nets collected recently-settled threespot dascyllus (less than 20 mm total length, TL) from anemones in the lagoon.  In the laboratory, fish were immersed in a seawater solution containing tetracycline antibiotic (250 mg l-1 of seawater for 12 hr; Schmitt 1984) to mark their otoliths, thereby enabling future verification of outplanted individuals.  Initial TL and weight were recorded for each fish, and they were assigned randomly to treatment.</para>
            <para>The anemones and outplanted threespot dascyllus were surveyed daily by SCUBA divers.  Any new threespot dascyllus that settled naturally were easily distinguished from the outplanted fish by the absence of pigmentation in their caudal peduncle and caudal fin (Schmitt and Holbrook 1997), and they were immediately removed.  When experimental fish were lost, replacement individuals were added to maintain the treatments; they were fin-clipped to distinguish them from the original outplants.  All losses of fish were considered mortalities as emigration is extremely unlikely at this life stage (Schmitt and Holbrook 1996, 1999a).</para>
            <para>After one month, fish were collected by SCUBA divers using hand nets.  Collection of fish occurred at approximately 1400 hr.  TL was measured for each fish and wet weight was determined using a Mettler-Toledo balance (XS104, Mettler-Toledo Inc., Columbus, OH).  Only individuals that remained on their host anemone for a minimum of two weeks were used in the analysis of individual growth rates, insuring sufficiently long exposure to their assigned treatment to have impacted their somatic growth.  We were unable to maintain the appropriate treatment on one of the anemones, so this anemone and its 4 resident fish were excluded from the final growth analysis.  Of the original 93 fish deployed, 68 individuals (73%) survived, and 6 additional replacement fish had resided on anemones for at least two weeks, for a total of 74 individuals used in the analysis of growth (mean length of outplant period = 29 days).  To assess differences in growth between treatments while taking into account differences in initial body sizes, daily growth rates were calculated for each individual using the following equation:
                (lnfinal length - lninitial length)					Equation 1
                number of days on host anemone
              </para>
            <para>We monitored survivorship of 623 three spot dascyllus residing on 28 anemones.  Survivorship was modeled using a generalized linear mixed model via penalized quasi-likelihood (glmmPQL) assuming a quasibinomial error distribution and right censored data.  The model generated by decoupling density and group size found group size to be non-significant, so only density was used as a predictor variable in the final analysis.  </para>
            <para>Otoliths, the digestive tract, and liver samples were removed from fish on the day of collection, then weighed and preserved.  Analysis of the gut contents was conducted for fish from the low density/small group size treatment (N = 11 fish) and the high density/large group size treatment (N = 16 fish).  Preserved gut contents from each sampled individual were spread in a petri dish and examined under a dissecting microscope.  All prey items were counted, and a subsample of 10 randomly selected prey items from each gut was identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible and sized.  In order to determine if there was an effect of fish density on the consumption of prey, the mean number of prey items present in the stomach was calculated for each of the two density treatments.</para>
          </section>
          <section>
            <title>Effects of density and group size on behavior</title>
            <para>We assessed patterns of key behaviors of the fish during the course of the field experiment.  GoPro&#174; video cameras were deployed during the daylight foraging period between 09:00 and 16:30 to provide estimates of feeding and intraspecific aggression rates, foraging distances from the host anemone, and vigilance.  These measures shed light on potential costs and benefits to fish living at different densities.  To determine feeding rates, bites per minute were recorded for focal individuals.  For each hour of video, feeding rate of a randomly selected fish in each of twelve two-minute time segments was measured.  During these same time segments, the total number of chases made by all individuals on the anemone also was recorded to quantify intraspecific aggression rates (calculated as number of chases/individual/min).  The total hours of video footage used in behavioral analyses were 12 (low density), 37 (medium density - small anemones with 3 fish each), 23 (medium density - large anemones with 6 fish each), and 16 (high density). </para>
            <para>Newly recruited threespot dascyllus rise above their host anemone to feed in the water column.  Individuals that forage higher in the water column than their conspecifics may have enhanced access to prey items, but the increased distance to shelter can result in higher vulnerability to predators.  To assess foraging distance (maximum distance (cm) an individual was observed away from the edge of its host anemone measurement) a calibrated pole was placed in the field of view for all video deployments to utilize as a reference.  Individuals that were observed to forage at distances greater than 30 centimeters from their host anemone, including all instances in which an individual foraged outside of the frame of the video, were assigned to a foraging distance category of &gt;30 cm.  Data were recorded for each fish on an anemone at twelve different time points per hour of video.</para>
            <para>A vigilance measurement quantified the amount of time individuals spent exhibiting anti-predatory behavior.  Average vigilance time was calculated by multiplying the per capita flight response rates and average refractory period for every individual that exhibited a flight response on each treatment.  A flight response was considered to occur when an individual was threatened and retreated into the host anemone.  The refractory period was defined as the length of time that elapsed between entry into the anemone shelter and emergence to resume feeding.  Data were recorded for one ten-minute segment within each hour of video.</para>
              <para>The influence of density-dependent and number-dependent processes on individual demographic rates often results in ecological tradeoffs.  Because such processes have important implications for individual level fitness and population regulation, they long have been an important topic in ecological research.  I used <emphasis>Dascyllus trimaculatus</emphasis>, a site-attached planktivorous coral reef fish, to determine independently the effects of population density and group size on rates of individual growth and mortality.  Somatic growth of <emphasis>D. trimaculatus</emphasis> was positively related to the density of <emphasis>D. trimaculatus</emphasis> outplanted to host anenomes, <emphasis>Heteractis magnifica</emphasis>, with nearly twice as much growth observed in individuals living in the highest density treatment.
