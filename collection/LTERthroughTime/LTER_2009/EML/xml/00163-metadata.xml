A comparison of rainfall patterns between a high and a low elevation station indicated that both annual and seasonal variations in rainfall are similar along the elevational gradient. However, the upper elevation station had greater annual mean rainfall (4436 mm/yr) compared to 3524 mm/yr) while the lower station had a greater variation in daily, monthly, and annual totals.  Model estimates indicate that a total of 3864 mm/yy (444 hm3) of rainfall falls on the forest in an average year. The Tabonuco, Colorado, Palm and Dwarf Forest types receive an estimated annual rainfall of 3537, 4191, 4167, and 4849 mm/yy, respectively. Of the average annual rainfall input, 65% (2526 mm/yr) is converted to runoff and the remainding 35% (1338 mm.yr) is lost from the system by evapotranspiration and other abstractions.

It has a warm and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance. Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Frederick</givenName><surName>Scatena</surName></individualName><organizationName>University of Pennsylvania</organizationName><positionName>Principal Investigator</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Earth and Environmental Science</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>240 South 33rd Street</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>156 Hayden Hall</deliveryPoint><city>Philadelphia</city><administrativeArea>PA</administrativeArea><postalCode>19104-6316</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(215)898-6907(5724)</phone><phone phonetype="fax">(787)766-6302</phone><electronicMailAddress>fns@sas.upenn.edu</electronicMailAddress><onlineUrl>http://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/</onlineUrl></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Luquillo Experimental Forest LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.

Correlations between elevation and stream-runoff and rainfall, elevation and air and soil temperature, and between trhoughfall and vegetation types have been found. These relationships are used inhydrologic and nutrient budgets as well as in environmental models .  Rainfall and Stream-runoff  Long-term rainfall and discharge data from the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) were analysed to develop relationships between rainfall, stream-runoff, and elevation. These relationships were then used with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine spatially-averaged, mean annual hydrologic budgets for watersheds and forest types within the study area. Model estimates indicate that a total of 3864 mm/yy (444 hm3) of rainfall falls on the forest in an average year. The Tabonuco, Colorado, Palm and Dwarf Forest types receive an estimated annual rainfall of 3537, 4191, 4167, and 4849 mm/yy, respectively. Of the average annual rainfall input, 65% (2526 mm/yr) is converted to runoff and the remainding 35% (1338 mm.yr) is lost from the system by evapotranspiration and other abstractions. In comparison to other tropical forests, the LEF as a whole has more evapotranspiration than many tropical montane forests but less evapotranspiration than many lowland tropical forests.  Throughfall  Changes in the quantity and quality of precipitation as it passes through vegetative cover are important components of both hydrologic and nutrient budgets.    :  (1) Pg = Sum( T n A n )+ Sum (Sm Dm)  Where Pg = total throughfall reaching the ground, Tn = canopy throughfall from vegetation type n, An = area of vegetation type n, Sm = stemflow from stem type m and Dm = number of stems in type m.  Using eqn. (1) to estimate total watershed throughfall becomes a problem of determining the minimum number of vegetation types necessary to describe the system at the required level of accuracy. In one of our studies, measured throughfall was compared with actual canopy and stem conditions to estimate the percentages of throughfall for different time periods was calculated by weighting the average throughfall and stemflow measured in representative areas of each vegetation type by the total area of that vegetation group.  Measurements reported here were made in two of the Bisley Research Watershed of the U.S. Forest Service. These adjacent watersheds drain 13.0 ha of highly dissected mountainous terrain that range in elevation from 265 to 455 m. Both watersheds are covered by Tabonuco type forests and were selectively logged at various times between 1860 and 1940 (Scatena, 1988). The dominant tree in the watersheds in the Tabonuco ( Dacryodes excelsa ) which often comprises as much as 35% of the canopy ( Wadsworth, 1970). Structurally the forest has three dominant layers, a discontinuous emergent strata, a continuous upper stratum at 20 m, and an understory layer. Leaves are mesophyllous and often covered with epiphytic growth.  Air and Soil Temperature  :  (2) Mean Air Temperature (in C) = 26.4 -(0.00558 * elevation in meters) and  (3) Mean Soil Temperature (in C) = 25.6 - (0.00543 * elevation in meters)  best fit these relationships. The equation that best fits the mean soil temperature - elevation relationship includes all the stations. In contrast, the best equation for the mean air temperature - elevation relationship excluded both station located at Sabana.</literalLayout></para></abstract><funding><para><literalLayout>USFS</literalLayout></para></funding></project><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=LUQ,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>bisleyANDr.txt</entityName><entityDescription>Bisley Rain Gauge weekly measurements</entityDescription><physical scope="document"><objectName>bisleyANDr.txt</objectName><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><recordDelimiter>\n</recordDelimiter><physicalLineDelimiter>\n</physicalLineDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://luq.lternet.edu/data/lterdb26/data/bisleyANDr.txt</url></online></distribution></physical><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><references>geoReference</references></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage id="temporalReferencebisleyANDr.txt" scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1987-07-30</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2002-12-31</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><method><methodStep><description><para><literalLayout>Total rainfall is measured by three different devices: a plastic funnel collector projected above the canopy and connected to a ground level storage bottle by 25m of plastic tubing; a recording gage in a clearing adjacent to the watersheds; and for the last 8 months of the study from October 1, 1987 to October 1, 1988, recording gages located on a 25m canopy observation tower and on the adjacent forest floor.
