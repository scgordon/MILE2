                <geographicDescription>The Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) covers 11,231 hectares and reaches 1079 m above sea level. It has a warm and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance. Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the significance of large-scale
                    disturbances in tropical forested ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription>

                    <para>
                        <literalLayout>Field Methods: We sampled 5 pools and 5 riffles in each stream. In each pool and in each riffle, we took 6 haphazardly chosen epilithic samples using a suction device modified from Loeb (1981, An in situ method for measuring the primary productivity and standing crop of the epilithic periphyton community in lentic systems. Limnology and Oceanography 26:394-399). The 6 samples were composited into a nalgene bottle for later analysis. We thus had a single
                            composited sample for each pool and each riffle. Bottles were brought back to the laboratory on ice. Data were collected twice per year (Spring~January and Summer ~June to August) from January 2002 to present. Loeb samples in pools were from rocks/boulders under water that was at least 3 inches deep. No specific depth criteria was used for riffles because they are shallow, but the sampled spot had to be deep enough for the Loeb sampler to work (i.e. the water had to
                            be as deep as the tiny side hole of the Loeb sampler). Riffle Loeb samples were only taken where the water was actually flowing. Lab methods: Each sample was sub-sampled for filtration onto 2 glass fiber filters. The first filter was a pre-weighed, pre-ashed filter for AFDM/inorganic matter analysis. The second filter was a pre-ashed filter for chlorophyll a analysis. Volumes filtered onto each filter were recorded as well as any volume not filtered. Three drops of 1%
                            MgCO3 were added to the chlorophyll subsample during filtration. Chlorophyll filters were immediately frozen. AFDM/inorganic matter filters were immediately dried at 50 C for at least 24 hours. Later, chlorophyll filters were analyzed fluorometrically according to standard methods [APHA (American Public Health Association). 1985. Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, 16. American Public Health Association, Washington, D.C.]. The AFDM/inorganic
                            matter filter was later weighed to the nearest 0.001 g, ashed at 500 C for 3 hours, and re-weighed to determine inorganic and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) per unit area.</literalLayout>
