cycling, microbial loop energetics, and the transport of materials across landscapes.  Since most of N (&gt; 90%) and P (around 90%) is in the organic form in the oligotrophic subtropical Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE), study of the source and dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ecosystem is crucial for the better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients.  FCE are composed of estuaries with distinct regions with different biogeochemical processes. Freshwater marsh primarily receives terrestrial input and local autochthonous vegetation production. Mangrove ecotone, nevertheless, is affected by the tidal contributions from Florida Bay and local mangrove production. Florida Bay (FB) is a wedge-shaped shallow oligotrophic estuary which lays south of the Everglades, the bottom of which is covered with a dense biomass of seagrass.  The sources of both freshwater and nutrients in FCE are difficult to quantify, owing to the non-point source nature of runoff from the Everglades and the dendritic cross channels in the mangroves.  Furthermore, the combination of multiple DOM sources (freshwater marsh vegetation, mangroves, phytoplankton, seagrass, etc.), and the potential seasonal variability of their relative contribution, along with the history of (photo)chemical and microbial diagenetic processing, and complex advective circulation, makes the study of DOM dynamics in FCE particularly difficult using standard schemes of estuarine ecology.  Quantitative information of DOM is very useful to investigate the biogeochemical cycling of DOM to a certain degree, however, qualitative information is necessary to better understand the source and dynamics of DOM.  Since fluorescence spectroscopic techniques are very sensitive, quick and simple, they have been applied to investigate the fate of DOM in estuaries.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Dissolved organic matter</keyword><keyword>Florida Coastal Everglades</keyword><keyword>Taylor Slough</keyword><keyword>Shark River Slough</keyword><keyword>Fluorescence Index</keyword><keyword>Absorbance</keyword><keyword>Specific UV absorbance</keyword><keyword>2004</keyword><keyword>2008</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>These data are classified as 'Type 3' whereby original FCE LTER experimental data collected by individual FCE researchers are available for scientific purposes 2 years after collection.

In advance the analysis, samples were acidified with 3M HCl, and purged with N2 gas to remove inorganic C.  Ancillary physical and chemical parameters were measured using standar methods as part of on-going estuarine water quality monitoring program http://www.serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork.  Detailed methods will be found elsewhere.  For escitation-emission matrix (EEM) measurements, fluorescences spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba (France) Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150-W continuous output xenon arc lamp under condition of 5.7-nm excitation and 2-nm emission slit widths and a 0.25 second response time.  Forty-four emission scans were acquired at excitation wavelengths (lamda ex) between 240 and 455 nm at 5 nm intervals. Them emission wavelengths were scanned from lamda ex + 10 nm to lamda ex + 250 nm at 2 nm intervals (Coble et al., 1993 and Coble, 1996).  All fluorescence spectra were acquired in ratio mode, whereby the sample (emission signal, S) and reference (excitation lamp output, R) signals were collected and the ratio (S/R) was calculated.  The ratio mode eliminates the influence of possible fluctuation and wavelength dependency of excitation lamp output. Several post-acquisition steps were involved in the correction of the fluorescence spectra.  First, an inner filter corrections was applied to the fluorescence data according to McKnight et al. (2001).  After inner filter corrections the sample EEM underwent spectral subtraction of the Milli-Q water to remove most of the effects due to Raman scattering.  Instrument bias related to wavelength dependent efficiencies of the specific instrument's optical components (gratings, mirrors, etc.) were then corrected by applying multiplication factors, supplied by the manufacturer, for both excitation and emission wavelengths for the range of observations.  Finally, the fluorescence intensity values were converted to quinine sulfate unit (QSU;1QSU=1 ngL-1 of quinine sulfate monohydroxide) to facilitate inter-laboratory comparisons (Coble et al., 1993).  From the 370 nm scan a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001).  Milli-Q water was used as a reference for all fluorescence analysis.  UV-visible measurements of the water samples were carried out with 1cm quartz UV-visible cells at room temperature (20 degrees C), using a Varian CARY 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer.

Forty-four emission scans were acquired at excitation wavelengths (lamda ex) between 240 and 455 nm at 5 nm intervals. Them emission wavelengths were scanned from lamda ex + 10 nm to lamda ex + 250 nm at 2 nm intervals (Coble et al., 1993 and Coble, 1996).  All fluorescence spectra were acquired in ratio mode, whereby the sample (emission signal, S) and reference (excitation lamp output, R) signals were collected and the ratio (S/R) was calculated.  The ratio mode eliminates the influence of possible fluctuation and wavelength dependency of excitation lamp output. Several post-acquisition steps were involved in the correction of the fluorescence spectra.  First, an inner filter corrections was applied to the fluorescence data according to McKnight et al. (2001).  After inner filter corrections the sample EEM underwent spectral subtraction of the Milli-Q water to remove most of the effects due to Raman scattering.  Instrument bias related to wavelength dependent efficiencies of the specific instrument's optical components (gratings, mirrors, etc.) were then corrected by applying multiplication factors, supplied by the manufacturer, for both excitation and emission wavelengths for the range of observations.  Finally, the fluorescence intensity values were converted to quinine sulfate unit (QSU;1QSU=1 ngL-1 of quinine sulfate monohydroxide) to facilitate inter-laboratory comparisons (Coble et al., 1993).  From the 370 nm scan a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001).  Milli-Q water was used as a reference for all fluorescence analysis.  UV-visible measurements of the water samples were carried out with 1cm quartz UV-visible cells at room temperature (20 degrees C), using a Varian CARY 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. Milli-Q water was used as the reference.</para></description><citation scope="document"><title>Evaluation of Specific Ultraviolet Absorbance as an Indicator of the Chemical Composition and Reactivity of Dissolved Organic Carbon</title><creator scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><givenName>L.</givenName><surName>Weishaar</surName></individualName></creator><pubDate>2003</pubDate><article><journal>Environmental Science and Technology</journal><volume>37</volume><pageRange>4702-4708</pageRange></article></citation><instrumentation>Whatman 0.7um glass fiber filers, Shimadzu TOC-5000A Analyzer, Jobin Yvon Horiba (France) Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer, Varian CARY 50 Bio UV visible spectrophotometer</instrumentation></methodStep><methodStep><description><para>Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were analyzed by a high-temperature combustion method with a Shimadzu TOC-5000A TOC analyzer.

Sampling stations can be largely grouped into 3 distinct districts based on the geomorphological features, that is, Florida Bay (FB, 3 sampling stations), Shark River Slough (SRS, 6 sampling stations), and Taylor Slough (TSPH, 8 sampling stations).  Surface water samples were taken from the these stations.  The samples were collected using pre-washed, brown Nalgen polyethylene bottles (Nalge Nunc International). Salinity of the water samples was measured in the field using an Orion salinity meter. The samples were stored on ice and returned to the laboratory within 8 h for analysis. Subsamples for spectroscopic analysis were filtered through precombusted Whatman GF/F glass fiber filters once received in the laboratory and analyzed

biogeochemical processes in aquatic environments such as elemental cycling, microbial loop energetics, and the transport of materials across landscapes.  Since most of N (&gt; 90%) and P (~90%) is in the organic form in the oligotrophic subtropical Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE), study of the source and dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ecosystem is crucial for the better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients.  FCE are composed of estuaries with distinct regions with different biogeochemical processes. Freshwater marsh primarily receives terrestrial input and local autochthonous vegetation production. Mangrove ecotone, nevertheless, is affected by the tidal contributions from Florida Bay and local mangrove production. Florida Bay (FB) is a wedge-shaped shallow oligotrophic estuary which lays south of the Everglades, the bottom of which is covered with a dense biomass of seagrass.  The sources of both freshwater and nutrients in FCE are difficult to quantify, owing to the non-point source nature of runoff from the Everglades and the dendritic cross channels in the mangroves.  Furthermore, the combination of multiple DOM sources (freshwater marsh vegetation, mangroves, phytoplankton, seagrass, etc.), and the potential seasonal variability of their relative contribution, along with the history of (photo)chemical and microbial diagenetic processing, and complex advective circulation, makes the study of DOM dynamics in FCE particularly difficult using standard schemes of estuarine ecology.  Quantitative information of DOM is very useful to investigate the biogeochemical cycling of DOM to a certain degree, however, qualitative information is necessary to better understand the source and dynamics of DOM.  Since fluorescence spectroscopic techniques are very sensitive, quick and simple, they have been applied to investigate the fate of DOM in estuaries.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514</para></funding><studyAreaDescription><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in Shark River Slough, Taylor Slough and Florida Bay in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these "upside-down" estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is:  In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.  Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.
