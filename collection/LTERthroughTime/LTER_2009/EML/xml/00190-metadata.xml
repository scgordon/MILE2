<abstract>
<para>This dataset contains site-level descriptions of environmental data (latitude, slope, aspect, moisture, soil pH and texture), pre-fire stand characteristics (tree density and basal area by species), and fire conditions from the 2004 fires (estimates of canopy and surface fire severity, including CBI, plus estimated stand age, date of burning, and distances to live seed sources). Each sample unit represents a site, and values often are site-level means of sub-samples. These data provide an initial baseline of environmental and fire conditions that can be used in interpreting long-term patterns of vegetation responses at the sites.</para>

<title>Experimental Design</title>
<para>In May of 2005, we established 90 study sites that burned between 19 June and 28 August, 2004 to monitor post-fire vegetation recovery. Field sites were selected in a stratified haphazard fashion to encompass the full range of fire severity and site moisture conditions present within the 2004 burns. The study sites were approximately equally distributed among three large fire complexes along the Taylor, Steese, and Dalton Highways in interior Alaska. Sites were located 50-600 m from the road in areas that were dominated by black spruce before burning. These sites included black spruce community subtypes ranging from moist acidic or non-acidic forests with an understory dominated by Eriophorum vaginatum tussocks, to non-acidic dry forests and elevational black spruce treeline (Hollingsworth et al. 2006). Tree mortality assessed in 2005 ranged from 30-100%, with most sites (82/90) having at least 95% canopy mortality. A subset of 39 sites was selected for intensive study, and the remaining 51 sites were designated as extensive sites.</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Methods</title>
<para>At each site we selected and permanently marked a 30x30 m sample area that was representative of a large (at least 0.25 ha) relatively homogeneous burned stand. We measured environmental conditions at all sites in 2005. Elevation, latitude, and longitude were measured at the plot center point with a hand-held GPS, and slope and aspect using a compass and hand-held inclinometer. Site moisture classes were estimated on a 6-point scale, ranging from xeric to sub-hygric, based on topography-controlled drainage conditions and adjusted for soil texture and presence of near-surface permafrost. Stand characteristics of the pre-fire forest were measured in 2006 in 2 parallel belt-transects that were 30 m in length and either 1 or 2 m in width for extensive and intensive sites, respectively. For each pre-fire tree rooted within the belt-transect, we measured the diameter at breast height (DBH) if the stem was over 1.4 m height, or tallied the number of stems for stems under 1.4 m height. Species were distinguished by trunk, branch, and cone morphology. Stems that branched above the ground surface were counted as a single stem, and the largest was measured for DBH. Fallen stems were included if originally rooted in the plot. Trees considered to be dead prior to the 2004 fire - based on extensive charring of the sapwood - were excluded from the analysis. From these data we calculated the total density (stems per ha, including all heights) and tree basal area (stem area per ha of trees &gt;1.4 m height) of each tree species in the pre-fire stand. To obtain an estimate of stand age, we obtained ring counts from 5 black spruce trees that were dominant or sub-dominant in the pre-fire tree canopy. Stem disks were sampled as close to the stem base as possible, dried, and sanded. Rings were then counted under a binocular microscope. We estimated the distance from the plot edge to the nearest unburned individual or stand of &gt;100 live trees by pacing distances less than 200 m or visually estimating (calibrated with measured road distances) for distances greater than 200 m. We measured fire severity in May-June 2005 using two ordinal metrics: 1) a canopy-severity index that estimated canopy consumption, and 2) the Composite Burn Index (Key and Benson 2005) that estimated mortality and consumption within surface, understory, and canopy layers of the forest stand. Our canopy severity index was estimated visually for canopy dominant and sub-dominant trees, where 1 = low consumption, with many brown or green needles remaining; 2 = low to moderate, with few needles but most small twigs remaining; 3 = moderate, with few small twigs remaining but many branches; 4 = moderate to high, with many lower canopy branches consumed; and 5 = high, with most branches and cones consumed. The Composite Burn Index (CBI) is a semi-quantitative index that has advocated as a synthetic metric for measuring fire severity in burned forests and is described by Key and Benson (2005). We also measured in 2006 two quantitative of post-fire seedbeds, which are affected by fire severity: organic layer thickness and organic layer cover. The depth of the residual, post-fire organic layer was measured at 11 randomly-selected points along a transect through the site. Relative cover of bare organic seedbeds (burned fibric and humic layers and dead moss) was recorded using point-intercept samples with 60 points per site. </para>
