  <abstract>
    <section>
      <para>In 1995, a removal study was initiated at the Sevilleta LTER to examine the response of vegetation following the removal of dominant species. Five sites were selected that were dominated by either blue grama (site 1), blue and black grama (site 2), black grama (site 3), black grama and creosote (site 4), or creosote (site 5). A sixth site was later added in the blue grama community along the foothills of the Los Pinos Mountains (site  6). At sites 1, 3, 5, and 6, five 3m x 4m plots had all plants of the dominant species removed; five 3m x 4m plots were controls. At site 2, 5 plots had blue grama removed, 5 plots had black grama removed, and 5 plots were controls. At site 4, 5 plots had black grama removed, 5 plots had creosote removed, and 5 plots were controls. Initial cover prior to removal was estimated by species for each plot. Grass was removed using a shovel to collect above-ground biomass and crowns just below the soil surface. Shrubs were removed using large clippers to collect above-ground biomass to the soil surface. All biomass removed was bagged, dried, and  weighed. Plot maintenance or removal of the target dominant species is performed annually or as needed. Rain gauges were installed at each site and the corners of the areas containing each set of plots GPS'd. Plot corners are marked by nails and are flagged periodically to aid identification and minimize foot traffic in the plots. Each northeast nail has a metal tag with site and plot number on it. Erosion bridges (1 m long) were installed in plots 1, 3 and 5 (removals and  controls) at sites 1-5. Initial measurements were made in 1996.</para>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Deep Well is located on McKenzie Flats and is site of the longest running SEV LTER met station, number 40, which has been active since 1988.&#160; In addition to studies of meteorological variables, core line-intercept vegetation transects and line-intercept transects from the 1995 and 2001 Deep Well fires are sampled here.&#160; The mini-rhizotron study, blue and black grama compositional comparison, blue and black grama patch dynamics investigation, and kangaroo rat population assessement are all ongoing here.&#160; Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is also the location of the warming and monsoon experiments, as well as portions of the line-intercept and vegetation removal studies.
On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the area of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed.&#160; While portions of this site were burned, the entirety was not.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the fire.Vegetation: The vegetation of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is Chihuahuan Desert Grassland, dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) and blue grama (B. gracilis).  Other grasses found at the site include dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) and threeawns (Aristida spp.).  Shrubs are uncommon but those that occur include Yucca glauca, Ephedra torreyi, and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens). Herbaceous plants include Plantago purshii, Hymenopappus filifolius, and globe mallows (Sphaeralcea spp.).

      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points is the area which encompasses the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote Core study sites and falls along the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats. Both sites are subject to intensive research activity, including NPP measurement, phenology observation, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments. There are drought rain-out shelters in both the Black Grama and Creosote sites, as well as the mixed-ecotone, with co-located ET Towers.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosotebush overstory with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra) and soapweed yucca as notable shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous dense grass dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama site and the relatively recent appearance of creosotebush. Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bush muhly (M. porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii). Notable forb species include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.).  Five Points Black Grama habitat is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary.  There is also a significant presence of shrubs, particularly broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), along with less abundant fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), club cholla (O. clavata), desert pricklypear (O. phaeacantha), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and what are presumed to be encroaching, yet sparsely distributed, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata).  Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Spike, sand, and mesa dropseed grasses (Sporobolus contractus, S. cryptandrus, S. flexuosus) and sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola) could be considered co-dominant throughout, along with blue grama (B. gracilis) in a more mesic, shallow swale on the site.  Notable forb species include trailing four o&#8217;clock (Allionia incarnata), horn loco milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis), sawtooth spurge (Chamaesyce serrula), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), blunt tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), wooly plaintain (Plantago patagonica), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and mouse ear (Tidestromia lanuginosa)., siteid: 2</geographicDescription>

          <para>
            <literalLayout>Collecting the Data:Each fall, during peak biomass (late Aug.-early Oct.), species richness and cover are visually observed in each plot. Data are entered onto a palmtop using the pre-formatted spreadsheet for ease of entry and transfer to a PC. The procedure is as follows: 1. Locate the metal tag on the northeastern nail and enter the site and plot code into the palmtop. 2. Depending on the treatment, certain species may need to be removed in and around the plot.  The removal codes are as follows: RU-Remove BOGR2, RA-Remove BOER4, and RC-Remove LATR2. Do not remove plants from the control (C) and total removal (TR) plots. 3. Thoroughly search each plot and record every species present. This is ideally done by 1-2 people, but a single observer is sufficient. 4. The percent canopy cover of each species in the plot is estimated visually using the following numerical ranges: T =  less than 0.1% 0.1-0.9% by intervals of 0.1% 1-5% by intervals of 0.5% 5-20% by intervals of 1.0% 20-100% by intervals of 5.0%Cover is estimated for all species as well as litter. Bare ground is calculated by subtracting the total cover of all species from 100%. Cover of less than 0.1% is recorded in the data as "T" (i.e., trace). It is advisable to re-flag plot corners and perform plot maintenance prior to assessing cover. To maintain the plots, clip any species to be removed from the edges and middle of the plot. Do not re-clip anything from the total removal plots. Laboratory procedures: Biomass removed from plots is dried, sorted by live and dead material, and weighed.Data description:In some years an exact date of data collection could not be found.&#160; Thus, "NA" is entered in the "DATE" column.&#160;  In 2003, there was no sampling day or month recorded for some sites and data for "DATE" was in various forms (i.e., year only, or mm/dd/year when a "dd"  of 1 did not correspond to the first day of the year).&#160;  See "COMMENTS" in these cases.</literalLayout>
