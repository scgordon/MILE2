Sampling is conducted at 15 mangrove creeks in two drainages: Rookery Branch and the North, Roberts, and Watson rivers.  The sampling in Rookery Branch expands over a 12-km stretch of ecotonal mangrove creeks upstream of Tarpon Bay.  Sampling started in the wet season of 2004, and has been conducted three times per year at these approximate times: November (wet season); February (transition); and April (dry season).  Electrofishing samples were processed in the field, and all species (except for non-natives) were returned live at the point of collection. In the Rookery Branch region, fish abundance varies markedly yearly and seasonally. Catches peak in the drier months, reflecting a pulse of movement by freshwater taxa into creeks as marshes upstream dry.  The timing of this pulse is closely tied to the pattern of water recession in upstream marshes, and has important ramifications for wading bird prey availability.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Electrofishing</keyword><keyword>Rookery Branch</keyword><keyword>Everglades National Park</keyword><keyword>fish</keyword><keyword>catches</keyword><keyword>2004</keyword><keyword>2008</keyword><keyword>Everglades season</keyword><keyword>wet</keyword><keyword>dry</keyword><keyword>transitional</keyword><keyword>salinity</keyword><keyword>visibility</keyword><keyword>turdidity</keyword><keyword>specific conductance</keyword><keyword>dissolved oxygen</keyword><keyword>percent dissolved oxygen</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>These data are classified as 'Type 2' whereby data are available for specific scientific purposes within 1 year after collection.

Electrofishing is used to target large-bodied predatory species.  At each creek, we systematically sample, three 100 meter long sections of creek bank by electrofishing (0-100m, 200-300m, and 400-500m). Each electrofishing bout lasts five minutes (pedal time). Electrofishing is an effective method for sampling large fishes in freshwater habitats, and eletrofishing catch per unit effort (CPUE) provides a reliable index of fish abundance.  For all bouts, electrofishing power is standardized to 1500 watts according to the ambient temperature and conductivity conditions.  Because creek width is considerably greater than the electric field generated by the electrofisher, a left or right bank was randomly selected for each bout.  Folling USGS-NAWQA guidelines, all electrofishing is conducted using intermittent application of electrical current to prevent fish from fleeing deep beneath the mangroves.  All fish captured are placed in a holding tank, identified, measured (to the nearest 1-mm standard or total length), weighed (if necessary), and released after full recovery.  We measure mass of those species for wich we do not have reliable length-mass regression equations with which to estimate mass-this procedure results in less handling of fishes and reduces stress on the specimens.  Only non-indigenous species are saved and preserved in 10 percent formalin to be returned to the laboratory for processing.  Although electrofishing typically targets large fish species, we routinely capture specimens as small as 5-cm standard length (SL).  During each sampling event, we use a YSI 85 unit to record physico-chemical parameters (water temperature, specific conductance/salinity, and dissolved oxygen) at the beginning of each electrofishing bout.  Water clarity and bottom type are measured with a measuring stick and turbidity with an electronic turbidity meter.</para></description><citation scope="document"><title>Improving electrofishing catch consistency by

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses:  Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514</para></funding><studyAreaDescription><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these "upside-down" estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is:  In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.  Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

region of Everglades National Park. In particular, we ask: (a) how does use of these river habitats by fishes change over long and short time scales?, (b) how do these changes relate to variation in abiotic conditions (i.e., salinity and freshwater inflow)?, and (c) how do changes in the fish community relate to anthropogenic activity (both previous drainage and impoundment and restoration efforts )? A key objective of this project is to establish critical pre-restoration baseline conditions for this habitat.</para></projectHypotheses><projectPermits><permit>EVER-2008-SCI-0016</permit></projectPermits><datasetAnomolies><anomolies>Some physiochemical readings are missing throughout the various years.

As Dr. Rehage's research sampling sites already existed in the FCE Oracle database, the 'Sitename' and 'Creek' columns together and made one column called "SITENAME".  The names found in the column were written out and joined with the creek number.  For Example: Sitename=RB, Creek=7 became RookeryBranch7.  2. all of the "." (which reflected no data value) to -9999 3. the headings on those that contained individual species counts to include 'count' in the name.  4. Parameter name changes were made as follows to better fit existing FCE parameters described in the database:  DO% became DO_perSat, DOMGL became DO, SPCOND became Specific_Conductance and SAL became Salinity.</notes></datasetInfoManagementNotes></additionalDataset></additionalMetadata></eml:eml>
