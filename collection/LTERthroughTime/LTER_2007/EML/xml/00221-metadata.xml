  <abstract>
    <section>
      <para>This study measured the population dynamics of coyotes in the grasslands and creosote shrublands of McKenzie Flats, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. The study was begun in January, 1992, and continued quarterly each year. &#160;Coyotes were sampled via scat counts along the roads of McKenzie Flats during winter, spring, summer, and fall of each year. The entire road transect was 21.5 miles in length. Scat counts over a week period (number of scats/mile/day) in each season along the roads were used to calculate the densities of coyotes (number of coyotes per square kilometer). Results from 1992 to 2002 indicated that autumn was the peak density period of the year, with generally steady declines through the year until the following autumn. Coyote populations appeared to fluctuate seasonally, but remained relatively stable at 0.27 +/- 0.03 (SE) coyotes per km2 during summer periods (this likely represents the "breeding pair" density, during which coyote pairs have set up territories and are raising young, but the pups have not as yet joined the parents in foraging activities).</para>

      <geographicDescription>Location: McKenzie Flats is located within the northeastern section of the Sevilleta NWR, encompassing an area from Black Butte south  to Palo Duro Canyon and east to the Los Pinos.Landform: McKenzie Flats is a broad, nearly flat grassland plain between the Los Pinos Mountains and the breaks on the east side of the Rio Grande., Geology: Deep (20,000 ft) alluvial and aeolian deposits., Soils: Turney Series:  fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Calciorthids.  Berino Series:  fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Haplargids., Hydrology: Surface water only during rain events, no arroyos.  Run-on plain for Los Pinos Mountains., Vegetation: The terrain is generally a mixed-species desert grassland, dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), blue grama (B. gracilis), sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola), various drop seeds and sacatons (Sporobolus spp.), purple three-awn (Aristida purpurea), and burrow grass (Scleropogon brevifolia).  Shrubs are common in the area around Five Points, including creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) and snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae)., Climate: Long-term mean annual precipitation is 243 mm, about 60% of which occurs during the summer.  Long-term mean monthly temperatures for January and July are 1.5 degrees C and 25.1 degrees C, respectively., History: McKenzie Flats encompasses an area of approximately 50 square miles and was one of the primary livestock grazing areas within what is now the Sevilleta NWR.  Cattle have been excluded from the site since 1974-76.  The ranch headquarters buildings and corrals were located at the junction of Legs C and D of the coyote survey.  , siteid: 25</geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points is the area which encompasses the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote Core study sites and falls along the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats. Both sites are subject to intensive research activity, including NPP measurement, phenology observation, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments. There are drought rain-out shelters in both the Black Grama and Creosote sites, as well as the mixed-ecotone, with co-located ET Towers.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosotebush overstory with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra) and soapweed yucca as notable shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous dense grass dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama site and the relatively recent appearance of creosotebush. Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bush muhly (M. porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii). Notable forb species include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.).  Five Points Black Grama habitat is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary.  There is also a significant presence of shrubs, particularly broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), along with less abundant fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), club cholla (O. clavata), desert pricklypear (O. phaeacantha), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and what are presumed to be encroaching, yet sparsely distributed, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata).  Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Spike, sand, and mesa dropseed grasses (Sporobolus contractus, S. cryptandrus, S. flexuosus) and sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola) could be considered co-dominant throughout, along with blue grama (B. gracilis) in a more mesic, shallow swale on the site.  Notable forb species include trailing four o&#8217;clock (Allionia incarnata), horn loco milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis), sawtooth spurge (Chamaesyce serrula), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), blunt tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), wooly plaintain (Plantago patagonica), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and mouse ear (Tidestromia lanuginosa)., siteid: 2</geographicDescription>

  <purpose>
    <para>
      <literalLayout>The purpose of the study was to assess the dynamics of coyote populations in the grasslands and creosote shrublands of the Sevilleta NWR. Coyotes are important predators and omnivores in these habitats, feeding on a wide variety of vertebrates, arthropods, and plants. Populations of prey species may be controlled to some extent by coyote predation, in which case coyotes may have significant influences on the biodiversity and species composition of the desert grassland ecosystem.</literalLayout>

            <literalLayout>&#160;Sampling Design: &#160;The scats were sampled along 21.5 miles of roadway that was broken up into four "legs" of varying lengths.Leg A:&#160;Black Butte southward to Five Points (5.7 miles).Leg B: Five Points eastward to the turnoff before Palo Duro Canyon (4.1 miles).Leg C: Palo Duro turnoff northward to the old McKenzie Headquarters site (6.1 miles).Leg D:&#160;McKenzie Headquarters site northwestward to Black Butte (5.6 miles).Sample Unit: &#160;Each scat was the unit of sample.Frequency of Sampling: &#160;Sampled one week per season, four seasons per year.Sample Size: &#160;Variable, depending on scat abundance.Technique Citations: &#160;Knowlton, Frederick F. 1984. &#160;Feasibility of Assessing Coyote Abundance on Small Areas. &#160;Unpublished Report, 14 pp.Measurement Techniques:&#160;The number of scats deposited by coyotes per mile of roadway per day in a typical western basin-and-range landscape has been shown to be correlated with the absolute density of&#160;coyotes. Therefore, the objective was to measure the deposition rate of coyote scats on the roads of McKenzie Flats.The process involved two samplings along the roads. &#160;The first sampling involved the "clearing" of scats from the 21.5 mile survey route, so as to initialize the roadway with zero scats. &#160;On the assigned day, the technician would drive an ATV slowly (less than 5 miles per hour) along the route. &#160;When a coyote scat was observed, the technician would stop and pick up the scat, placing it into a zip-lock plastic bag that was labeled with the date and the "leg" letter. &#160;Each "leg" was bagged separately. &#160;The odometer reading of the scat location was recorded on the data sheet. &#160;If more than one scat was observed at the same place, the number of scats was recorded as well. For health and safety, the technician wore gloves during this process, or used tongs or a small trowell to pick up the scats and place them into the bag. &#160;When using the ATV, the technician wore a safety helmet.During the early sampling periods (1992 to 1993), prior to the acquisition of the ATV in 1994, scats were collected by two technicians in a pick-up truck. One technician would drive, and the other would ride on the engine hood above the bumper, and scan the road as the truck was driven slowly along the road. &#160;When a scat was observed, the driver would stop the truck while the rider would collect the scat. &#160;The same data were recorded as described above.One week following the "road clearing" survey, a second collection took place. &#160;The scats were sampled in the same fashion as before, but each scat was placed individually in a labelled small zip-lock plastic bag. &#160;Again, odometer readings were taken at the point of collection. &#160;Multiple scats from the same location were placed in separate plastic bags.The scats were then returned to the field station, and placed in freezers for preservation pending analysis of dietary items.Analytical Procedures:&#160;Density values were computed as numbers of individuals per square kilometer. &#160;According to F. Knowlton (see reference above), the relationship between absolute densities of coyotes (x-value, independent variable) and the number of scats per night per mile x 100 (y-value, dependent variable) is:&#160;&#160; &#160;Y = 2.66 + 11.42X, r2 = 0.97, n = 8Transforming this equation for computing densities of coyotes from numbers of scats for each "leg" of the survey, and converting these values to numbers of coyotes per square kilometer, the coyote density equations&#160;for each survey "leg" are as follows:&#160;&#160; &#160; D = Density of coyotes/km2, &#160;N = Total Number of Scats Collected/Leg&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; after a 7-day period.&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;Leg A (5.7 miles): &#160; D = [0.2195(N) - 0.2329]/2.59&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;Leg B (4.1 miles): &#160; D = [0.3052(N) - 0.2329]/2.59&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;Leg C (6.1 miles): &#160; D = [0.2052(N) - 0.2329]/2.59&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;Leg D (5.6 miles): &#160; D = [0.2235(N) - 0.2329]/2.59</literalLayout>
