                Schwarz and others established between 1995-1998. Data collected on these plots led
                to the following two publications (1,2) and a doctoral thesis (3). The dataset
                includes tree tag number, diameter breast height (DBH), crown status (4 classes),
                and tree status (4 classes) of all trees over 10cm DBH during the sampling period of
                1995-1998. It also contains UTM coordinates for each plot. Physical plot attributes
                are posted in a different dataset on this website. Soils data (soil chemistry,
                depth, exchangeable cations, and texture) and a tree recruitment inventory were also
                taken on these plots. Soils data and tree recruitment data are also posted
                separately on this website.</literalLayout></para></section><section><title>SAMPLING DESIGN</title><para><literalLayout>Plot establishment - The following methods related to plot
                establishment are excerpted from Schwarz et al 2003 (see below for reference):
                "Fifteen N&#8211;S transects were established at 500-m intervals to span the entire
                Hubbard Brook Valley (Fig.1). Along the transects, a regular array of 431 500-m2
                circular plots was established at distance intervals of either 25 m, 100 m, or 200
                m. The sampling layout and spacing of the plots was designed to facilitate the
                analysis of spatial patterns in the forest vegetation by utilizing a wide range of
                distance intervals between plots (Fortin et al. 1989). "</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>The intention was that each plot would contain 50 to 60 canopy-sized
                trees. Some forest stands were considerably more dense than this (usually they were
                spruce/fir stands), and under these circumstances the plot radius was reduced to 10
                m (314 m2). Each plot was identified with a gray PVC pipe placed in the center of
                the plot with a round aluminum ID tag and UTM coordinates. UTM coordinates were
                taken at plot center. The plots were arranged along N-S transects originating at the
                Forest Service road along Hubbard Brook.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Adult tree inventory - Within each plot, all trees (both alive and
                dead) greater than or equal to 10 cm at breast height (BH, 1.37 m) were measured and
                tagged with a rectangular, numbered aluminum tag secured with a 3 inch aluminum
                nail. DBH was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm, and measurements were made from the
                uphill side of a tree. Trees were tagged sequentially from the inside to the outside
                edge of the plot and in a clockwise direction around the plot. The first tree tagged
                in each plot should be a tree uphill from the plot center growing along (or near)
                the painted N-S transect line. The tags should all face the plot&#8217;s center.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>After a tree was measured and tagged, it was identified to species
                (using the appropriate species code). A tree&#8217;s crown status was assigned to one of
                four categories: dominant (D), codominant (C), intermediate (I), or suppressed (S).
                A dominant rating implies that the top of the tree&#8217;s canopy was above its neighbors
                and was in no way competing for light. A codominant rating implies that the tree was
                sharing the top of the forest canopy with one adjacent neighboring tree and was
                competing with that neighbor for light. An intermediate rating implies that the
                tree&#8217;s canopy was at the level of the forest canopy but was sharing the canopy with
                two or more adjacent neighboring trees. A suppressed rating implies that the tree&#8217;s
                canopy was below the forest canopy and was light limited. Its crown condition was
                rated as either (I), if 80&#8211;100% of the tree&#8217;s potential foliage was intact; (2), if
                50&#8211;80%; (3), if 10&#8211;50%; or (4), if less than 10% of the potential foliage was
                intact. Any unusual characteristics of the tree were also noted e.g., tree was
                leaning, roots growing around a boulder, etc. Assessing a tree&#8217;s crown status and
                condition tends to be the most difficult measurement because it is so subjective.
                Occasionally there are legitimate differences of opinion. However, the purpose of
                assessing a tree&#8217;s crown status and condition was to relate its canopy position to
                its potential growth rate. This purpose was kept in mind when assessing trees.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Special cases - Wounded trees: If a tree had a wound at breast height,
                then was measured either above or below BH and noted as such. The DBH measurements
                were used to calculate forest basal area and biomass, so the most representative
                measurement of the tree was used.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Clumped trees: If there was more than one stem originating from the
                same root system, then each stem that was 10 cm DBH or larger was measured as a
                separate tree and given a unique tag. These clumps were noted on the data
              sheet.</literalLayout></para></section></description><citation scope="document"><title>Factors controlling spatial variation of tree species abundance in a forested
