  <abstract>
    <section>
      <para>Several long-term studies at the Sevilleta LTER measure net primary  production (NPP) across ecosystems and treatments. Net primary production is a fundamental ecological variable that   quantifies rates of carbon consumption and fixation. Estimates of NPP   are important in understanding energy flow at a community level as well   as spatial and temporal responses to a range of ecological processes.  Above-ground net  primary production (ANPP) is the change in plant biomass,  including loss to  death and decomposition, over a given period of time.  To measure this  change, vegetation variables, including species  composition and the cover and height of individuals, are sampled up to three times  yearly (winter, spring, and fall) at permanent plots within a study site. The weight data presented here is obtained by harvesting a series of covers for species observed during plot sampling. These species are always harvested from habitat comparable to the plots in which they were recorded. This data is then used to make volumetric measurements of species and build regressions correlating biomass and volume. From these calculations, seasonal biomass and seasonal and annual NPP are determined.</para>

      <geographicDescription>Location: The Cerro Montosa Pinyon-Juniper site has been the location of major Sevilleta LTER research since 1989. Meteorological trends, net primary productivity, rodent and ground-dwelling arthropod populations, mycorrhizal responses to fertilizer, pinyon-juniper fruit and nut production, and pinyon mortality are all being investigated at this site. Previous studies have included analyses of pinyon tree rings for regional climate reconstruction.Vegetation: The vegetation is New Mexico Pinyon-Juniper Woodland, dominated by Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis) and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), and accompanied by gray oak (Quercus grisea).  There is a diverse shrub component, including scrub live oak (Q. turbinella), mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), sacahuista (Nolina microcarpa), red barberry (Mahonia haematocarpa), Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), skunkbush (Rhus trilobata), and banana yucca (Yucca baccata).  Grass diversity is also high, and open spaces between trees are dominated by blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), with hairy and sideoats grama (B. hirsuta and B. curtipendula) and black grama (B. eriopoda) also being significant. Other common grasses include purple threeawn (Aristida purpurea), wolftail (Lycurus phleoides), mountain and ring muhly (M. montanus and M. torreyi), and New Mexican porcupinegrass (Heterostipa neomexicana). Common forbs include small-flowered milkvetch (Astragalus nuttallianus), white sagebrush (Artemesia ludoviciana), Fendler&#8217;s arabis (Arabis fendleri), Fendler&#8217;s sandmat (Chamaesyce fendleri), New Mexico thistle (Cirsium neomexicanum), false pennyroyal (Hedeoma oblongifolia), bastard sage (Eriogonum wrightii), ping&#252;e rubberweed (Hymenoxys richardsonii), large four o&#8217;clock (Mirabilis multiflora), Fendler's penstemon (Penstemon fendleri), and globemallows (Sphaeralcea hastulata and S. wrightii). , </geographicDescription>

      <geographicDescription>Location: Deep Well is located on McKenzie Flats and is site of the longest running SEV LTER met station, number 40, which has been active since 1988.&#160; In addition to studies of meteorological variables, core line-intercept vegetation transects and line-intercept transects from the 1995 and 2001 Deep Well fires are sampled here.&#160; The mini-rhizotron study, blue and black grama compositional comparison, blue and black grama patch dynamics investigation, and kangaroo rat population assessement are all ongoing here.&#160; Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is also the location of the warming and monsoon experiments, as well as portions of the line-intercept and vegetation removal studies.
On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the area of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed.&#160; While portions of this site were burned, the entirety was not.&#160; See individual projects for further information on the effects of the fire.Vegetation: The vegetation of Deep Well Blue/Black Grama Mixed is Chihuahuan Desert Grassland, dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) and blue grama (B. gracilis).  Other grasses found at the site include dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) and threeawns (Aristida spp.).  Shrubs are uncommon but those that occur include Yucca glauca, Ephedra torreyi, and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens). Herbaceous plants include Plantago purshii, Hymenopappus filifolius, and globe mallows (Sphaeralcea spp.).

      <geographicDescription>Location: Five Points is the area which encompasses the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote Core study sites and falls along the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats. Both sites are subject to intensive research activity, including NPP measurement, phenology observation, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments. There are drought rain-out shelters in both the Black Grama and Creosote sites, as well as the mixed-ecotone, with co-located ET Towers.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosotebush overstory with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra) and soapweed yucca as notable shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous dense grass dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama site and the relatively recent appearance of creosotebush. Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bush muhly (M. porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii). Notable forb species include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.).  Five Points Black Grama habitat is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary.  There is also a significant presence of shrubs, particularly broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), along with less abundant fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), club cholla (O. clavata), desert pricklypear (O. phaeacantha), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and what are presumed to be encroaching, yet sparsely distributed, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata).  Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Spike, sand, and mesa dropseed grasses (Sporobolus contractus, S. cryptandrus, S. flexuosus) and sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola) could be considered co-dominant throughout, along with blue grama (B. gracilis) in a more mesic, shallow swale on the site.  Notable forb species include trailing four o&#8217;clock (Allionia incarnata), horn loco milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis), sawtooth spurge (Chamaesyce serrula), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), blunt tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), wooly plaintain (Plantago patagonica), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and mouse ear (Tidestromia lanuginosa)., siteid: 2</geographicDescription>

            <literalLayout>Generating Cover Range for Harvest Samples:Prior to making harvest collections, a range of cover values and the number of observations is generated for each plant species recorded at a site from the NPP data. A perl script is located in pc_field/palmtop/npp. This script will generate a list of species with the minimum and maximum cover and number of observations from all excel files in the folder. From these values a range of covers to be harvested will be produced. To produce a range for a species, first decide the  number of samples you will be collecting for that species.  15 samples will be collected for  dominant or frequently observed species and 10 samples will be collected for most other species.   Next decide if you will be making this range based on counts or cover measurements.  The majority  of species will be based on cover measurements.  Only extremely small plants will be based on count  measurements. For ranges based on cover measurements, start by writing down the cover value one  size-class below the smallest cover observed at a site.  For example, if the smallest cover  observed at a site was 0.5 write down 0.25.  If smallest cover value observed is 0.01 do not go  below this value.  Next write down the cover value one size-class above the largest cover value  recorded at a site.  These two numbers represent the largest and smallest covers that will be  harvested at a site.  Within the bounds of these two numbers fill in cover values. Ultimately you  will need to end up with either 10 or 15 cover values depending on the observed frequency of the  species. Try and keep the numbers as balanced as possible.  Smaller covers will have more  variability than larger covers and thus it is best to collect duplicates of the smaller cover  sizes.  Also, as covers increase the size-class increments between covers should also increase.   When generating these ranges keep in mind that the purpose of harvest samples is to produce a  statistical linear regression equation for each species at each site from which biomass will be  estimated. A similar process is used to obtain a range of values for samples that will be based on  counts. Enter the species ranges, date and site into a Sevilleta LTER NPP Harvest Data book.   Once this is complete, label collection bags.  In general, harvests with covers between 0.01 and  0.5 are collected into coin envelopes and larger covers are placed in paper bags.  Label each bag  or envelope with the date, site, plant species, sample number, and cover value.  Leave a blank spot  for height.Collecting Harvest Samples:&#160;Collect plants from an area that is close to but not actually on the trapping webs or NPP plots at each site. &#160;Avoid collecting plants near the roadside since these plants may have morphologies that vary from plants on the NPP quadrats. From 1999 to 2003, the site of collection corresponds to the site where the data were collected (see above for site codes). &#160;In 2004, several new sites were added that had been burned by a prescribed fire in 2003. &#160;Separate weight data was needed for the burned and unburned plants at these sites. Therefore, after 2004 a new &#160;variable "type" was added. &#160;And, a new site "L" was added. &#160;"L" refers to all the Lower sites and does not include P or J. &#160;The new variable "type" has four codes. &#160;"B" refers to harvested plants that were burned in the 2003 fire, and "U" refers to plants that were not burned in recent history. &#160;However many plants grow similarly in both treatments, especially annual plants and some perennial forbs. &#160;These plants are designated type "F" and can be harvested from either burned or unburned areas. &#160;Type "A" is the default and applies to all pre-2004 data as well as the Cerro Montosa site P. In Fall of 2010, type "B" refers to samples that were harvested from area of the Sevilleta that were burned by a wildfire in August 2009. The one exception was for creosote that was still harvested from the 2003 prescribed burn area.Locate individual plants that correspond to the cover values written on a bag. Measure the height of the plant to the nearest cm and write this height on the bag. &#160;Then with a pair of shears clip the foliage and place it in the bag. &#160;It is important to collect all of the foliage and to clip it off as near to the base as possible. &#160;Do not include any root material in the sample.If you cannot find a natural clump of foliage of a particular cover value you may take a sub-sample from a larger plant. &#160;This should be done only when absolutely necessary. The most important thing to remember is&#160;that foliage harvests need to have a similar morphology to plants measured on the quadrats. &#160;If a sub-sample must be taken try to collect a sample that seems representative of a cover that would occur naturally on a quadrat.After a sample has been collected fold the bag so that no portion of the sample can fall out. &#160;When all the samples of a species have been collected, indicate that the collection of that species is complete in the Harvest Data book. &#160;Place the samples into a large plastic garbage bag and try to keep them in a cool location until you are able to store them.Sorting Harvest Samples:&#160;Empty the contents of a single bag onto a large tray or newspaper. Pick through the foliage and separate live stems, leaves and inflorescence from dead material. For Fall, consider any yellow or green material as live material and any brown or gray material as dead. Store the dead material in a separate bag. &#160;For Spring, consider only green material as live and discard yellow, brown and gray material. &#160; When you have finished sorting live from dead, place the live material back in the original bag and discard the dead material, except for Fall samples. &#160;Bags containing sorted material are then placed in a drying oven located at the Sevilleta field station. &#160;Dry the bags for 4 days at 50 degrees C or until completely dry. &#160;It usually takes 6-10 days for cacti to dry in the oven and the samples should be dried separately from other samples. &#160;Before placing cacti in the oven perforate them several times with a knife to promote the escape of moisture. &#160;Remove the bags with the samples from the oven when they are completely dry. The plants should be very brittle. Store the plants in a dry location until weighed.Weighing Harvest Samples:&#160;Try to weigh the samples as soon after drying as possible so that the do not re-absorb any moisture. &#160;Sort the bags by species and site so that these can be weighed at the same sitting. Remove the sample from the bag and place it into a tarred tray. &#160;Make sure that no portion of the plant remains in the bag. &#160;Weigh the sample to the nearest centigram. &#160;Record the date of collection, site (L, the lower flats or P, the pinyon-juniper), the type of collection (A, unburned or B, burned) plant species, sample number, cover value, height and weight into the Sevilleta LTER NPP Harvest Mass Data book. &#160;Set the sample aside. &#160;When all samples of a particular species and site have been weighed, combine the dry material and retain 50g for a voucher specimen. &#160;Discard any excess material. &#160;If there is not enough dry material to make up 50g just retain what is there. &#160;Place the voucher specimen into a paper bag labeled voucher with the date of collection, site (L or P), type (A or B), plant species, and approximate weight of the sample.&#160;Notes: &#160;In 1999 and 2000, all species from all sites were collected. &#160;In 2001and seasons 1 and 2 of 2002, only those species that had not yet been encountered were harvested. &#160;In Fall of 2002, the regressions were studied and many species with irregular regressions were harvested again. &#160;In winter of 2003, much of the data was lost and has not been recovered. &#160;From spring of 2003 to the present, problem species (bad or inconsistant regressions), &#160;new species, and dominant species at each site have been harvested each season.</literalLayout>
