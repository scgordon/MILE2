		<abstract>
			<para>Living and dead trees and abiotic and anthropogenic characteristics of the shoreline
				were surveyed at 488 sites around lakes in Vilas County. These data were collected as part
				of the "cross-lake comparison" segment of the Biocomplexity Project (Landscape Context -
				Coordinated Field Studies). The study explored the links between terrestrial and aquatic
				systems across a gradient of residential development and lake landscape position.
				Specifically, this project attempted to relate the abundance of coarse wood in the littoral
				zone with abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic features of the adjacent shore. At each of the
				488 sites, three 100 sq m plots, extending from the shoreline 10 m inland, were sampled.
				Additional plots farther inland were sampled at some sites. At each plot the survey team
				recorded the general appearance of the plot, measured all trees at least 5 cm dbh, measured
				and described downed wood and snags at least 10 cm in diameter, and recorded any overhanging
				trees. Saplings (at least 30 cm tall, but less than 5 cm dbh) were counted in two 5m x 5m
				plots per site. Sampling Frequency: each site sampled once Number of sites: 488 sites on 61
				Vilas County lakes were sampled from 2001-2004 (approximately 15 different lakes each year;
				eight sites per lake). </para>

						<para>Riparian sampling PREPARATION Datasheet packets: Each lake has 8 survey sites. One
							packet per site: 3 10m x 10m riparian zone plot data sheets 1 Sapling plot or General
							Site Info data sheet For 2 of the 8 sites, packets will need to include 2 riparian
							subzone data sheets. Weather can be highly variable. Data sheets should be printed on
							write in rain paper. Survey site selections: 8 Sites per lake will be selected using
							GIS software. Subzones: To look at the effects of wind, sun, and fetch; select 2 of
							the 8 sites for additional subzone surveys. One site must be located in the NW quarter
							of the lake and the other in the SE. Within each of these 2 chosen sites, randomly
							select a 10m x 10m subzone plot in zone 2 and another 10m x 10m subzone plot in zone
							3. (See figure 1). Sapling plots: At each site, two 5m x 5m sapling plots should be
							randomly selected within plots A, C, andoror E (Refer to figure 3). EQUIPMENT LIST
							Clipboard, data sheet packets, lake and site maps, pencils, watch, compass, 50m
							measuring tapes, Diameter tapes (fabric and combination tapes), flagging, GPS unit,
							Oars, cushions and vests, motor, gas. Appropriate rain gear and boots. FIELD DATA
							COLLECTION Record the lake name, site number, plot number, date, observers, start and
							stop time. Collect a GPS point at the start of each of the 8 survey sites (plot A).
							timesIf the site has to be relocated due to denied permissions, mark new location on
							lake maps. Prepare Survey Plots: Each site is 30m x 50m in size. Five 10mx10m plots
							along shoreline are the zone 1 survey plots. Subzones are located in Zones 2 and 3.
							Plots should never overlap. Set up plots (A, C, E) Facing the selected site location
							(looking from the water towards shore), plot A is on the left, C and E are to the
							right of A respectively. Mark the sites starting point (with a flag and a GPS point).
							Using a meter tape to place flags at 10m increments along the shorelines ordinary high
							water mark (0m, 10m, 20m, 30m, 40m, 50m). For each 10x10 plot, determine the shoreline
							aspect, then use a compass and meter tape to place corner flags back 10 meters from
							shore so that each plot is square. Record the slope and aspect (perpendicular to
							shore) for the start of plots A, C, and E. This will represent the hills steepness and
							direction. Recording Data: General site info: Site information must be recorded for
							all 5 plots (A, B, C, D, and E) Record ownership (public or private). List the number
							of docks and buildings &#226;&#128;&#147;count them only once if they cross into 2 plots.
							Presenceorabsence information &#226;&#128;&#147; Using the list provided, check anything that is
							present, or list it as other. Record what is dominant. There are 2 parts to the
							General site info list: Qualitative assessment of habitat (forest stands, herbaceous,
							wetlands, etc). Human development andoror disturbance. FOR PLOTS A, C, and E: Live
							Trees: Record the species and diameter at breast height (DBH) for every living tree
							that is larger or equal to 5cm DBH (other woody plants having a greater than or equal
							to 5cm DBH should also be recorded). Diameter at breast height: Since trees are
							swelled at the base, measurements are made 4.5 feet (1.37 meters) above the ground in
							order to give an average diameter estimate. Trees on plot edge: Sometimes trees will
							be questionable as to whether they are in or out of the plot. Good rule of thumb is a
							50percent cut off. If the tree is more than 50percent within the plot, count it. Do
							not count 1 tree in more than one plot! Standing snags: A snag is a (or part of a)
							dead standing tree taller than 1.37 meters (DBH). If a snag is greater than or equal
							to 10cm DBH then record type (snag), type of break (natural, un-natural, beaver),
							species (if known), DBH, and branchiness (0-3). Stumps: A stump is dead tree cut or
							broken off below 1.37 meters (DBH). Record stumps that are greater than or equal to
							10cm in diameter. Take the diameter at the base of the stump but above the root mass.
							Record type (stump), type of break (natural, un-natural, beaver), species (if known),
							and diameter at base. Branchiness is assumed to be 0. Coarse Woody Debris (CWD) in
							Riparian zone: For this study, CWD is considered any logs greater than or equal to
							10cm in diameter and greater than or equal to 150cm in length. Record type (log) and
							type of break (natural, un-natural, beaver, unknown). Record the species type
							(species, conifer, hardwood, or unknown), the diameter at base, and log length from
							base to longest branch tip. Record Branchiness (0-3). Where 0 is no branches, 1 is
							few, 2 is moderate, and 3 is many branches. Record Decay (0-5). Where 0 is a live tree
							touching the ground at two or more points, 1 is recent downwood (e.g. lacking litter
							or moss cover), 2 is downwood with litterorhumus or moss cover; bark sound, 3 is bark
							sloughing from wood; wood still sound, 4 is downwood mostly barkless; staubs
							loosening; wood beginning to decay; logs becoming oval and in contact with the ground
							along most of their length, and 5 is decay advanced; pieces of wood blocky and
							softened; logs becoming elliptically compressed. timestimes NOTE: paper birch retains
							its bark long after the wood has rotted, score logs of this species by the softness of
							the wood, not the presenceorabsence of bark. timestimes Additional parameters: If a
							log extends out of a plot, record its entire length and measure diameter at the base
							regardless of whether the base is inside or outside of the plot. If a log crosses into
							more than one plot, record the entire length and measure diameter at the base, but
							record log only in the plot where the base is (if the base is outside of the site,
							then record in the plot closest to the base). Paper birch: often are broken into many
							small parts. If segments are still in line (no more than ~5 cm separating them), then
							you can count breaks as a single log. Logs that extend over the water are measured
							only from the base to the shoreline and listed in notes as measured to water. For each
							site, Two 5m x 5m sapling plots are randomly selected in plots A, C, andoror E. Use
							the numbering scheme depicted in graphic. Use compass and meter tape to setup and mark
							square plots using the original plot aspect. For each sapling plot, count and record
							all tree saplings greater than 30 centimeters in height but having less than a 5 cm
							DBH. Subzones: Subzone plot data are recorded the same as plot data. Refer to figure 1
							to set up random subplots at 2 of the 8 sites at a lake. Use compass and meter tape to
							setup and mark square subplots. Use the original plot aspect when possible. For each
							square 10m x 10m subplot (one in zone 2 and one in zone 3) record slope and aspect.
							Record all live trees that have greater than or equal to 5cm DBH. Record all stumps
							greater than or equal to 10cm DBH and snags greater than or equal to 10cm diameter at
							base. Record logs greater than or equal to 10cm in diameter and greater than or equal
							to 150cm in length. &#194;&#160; </para>
					</section>
					<section>
						<para>Littoral Characterization: Locate the riparian sampling site. Littoral zone
							transects are parallel to the riparian zone survey sites. Place flags at 10m intervals
							to create 5 segments. Segments are labeled from left to right- A, B, C, D, and E.
							Count the number of docks on the shoreline AND at the 0.5 m depth contour for each 10
							m segment. Count only those docks which actually touch the shore or cross the
							transect. A dock is defined to be 1 m wide (=10percent of segment). L-shaped or extra
							wide docks should be counted as 2or more docks &#226;&#128;&#147; ONLY if the extra wide or L portion
							ACTUALLY CROSSES THE TRANSECT. Characterize the vegetation at the ordinary high
							watermark and back 0.5 m (so that this data will be different from the general site
							info data). Assess the percentage of the segment (A, B, C, D or E) covered by
							Forested, Overhanging Trees, Overhanging Shrubs, Shrub Thicket, Shrubs, Wetlands,
							Herbaceous, Lawn, Engineered, Beach or Dock. These values should total 100percent.
							Count number of overhanging trees in each segment (Count only trees whose trunks are
							inclined at 45degree or more andoror have a large portion of their canopy hanging over
							the water). Score each tree for branchiness and degree of overhang (45- 65degree = 0;
							65- 90degree = 1) Characterize Substrate at both the shoreline and the 0.5 m depth
							contour for each 10 m segment: Sand, pebble, Rock, Organic debris (muck) or silt.
							Score for presenceorabsence and mark which one is dominant. For 0.5 m depth contour,
							grab a handful of substrate and classify it 2-3 times per 10m segment Measure distance
							from shore to the 0.5 m depth contour at the beginning and end of the transect
							Littoral CWD: Measure diameter of CWD encountered along the inside edge of the
							half-meter depth contour at the point where the log crosses the contour line (but
							orthogonal to the log itself). Do not measure logs that are completely submerged under
							the substrate. Tally all logs greater than or equal to 5 cm but less than 10 cm
							diameter and greater than 150 cm in length by 10 m segment (record no further
							measurements on these logs). For logs greater than 10 cm diameter (at the point where
							they cross the transect) and longer than 150 cm, determine total length, decay class,
							elevation, orientation, amount of branching,10 m segment (A,B, C, D, E) where first
							encountered and the number of other 10cm logs that cross the subject log between 0 and
							1 m depth (see illustrations below). If a log has a branch that is greater than 10 cm
							in diameter and longer than 150 cm AND it crosses the transect, count it as a log,
							measuring the length from the point of attachment to the main log to the tip of the
							branch. Put a check mark in the notes column if you encounter any logs like this.
							Elevation (taken at the point of intersection with the .5m contour) 0: logs which are
							partially submerged or resting on the bottom 1: logs slightly elevated from the bottom
							(up to about a palm-width off the bottom) 2: more elevated than 1, but not floating 3:
							floating on the surface of the lake or elevated above the surface of the water at the
							.5 m transect but submerged at the waterline. Orientation: parallel, Perpendicular,
							Oblique 0- 30degree and 150- 180degree = parallel; 30- 60degree and 120&#226;&#128;&#147; 150degree =
							oblique and 60-120degree = perpendicular Branchiness: 0: no branches, 1: few branches
							2: moderate number of branches 3: many branches (full crown) Decay: 1: recently
							downed, 2: algal growth but bark still sound, 3: bark sloughing off but wood still
							sound, 4: wood soft, 5: wood very soft no longer structurally sound NOTE: paper birch
							retains its bark long after the wood has rotted, score logs of this species by the
							softness of the wood, not the bark Number of Intersections: Biocomplexity Littoral
							Sampling Intersections Diagram Other Notes If the substrate is too soft to support the
							weight of the investigator, snorkel along the transect. As a last resort, row the boat
							along your best estimate of the half-meter contour. Have one person hang off the front
							of the boat and feel for CWD on the bottom. If you have to row or snorkel a transect,
							record this information on the data sheet. Water Lily (Nuphar and Nymphaea) rhizomes
							are not considered CWD IF YOU ENCOUNTER A SITUATION NOT COVERED HERE, MAKE A JUDGEMENT
							CALL AND WRITE IT DOWN BOTH ON THIS SHEET AND ON THE DATA SHEET FOR THAT SITE &#194;&#160;

			<abstract>
				<para>Surprises - large, unexpected changes from apparently small causes -- are common in
					systems of people and nature. Are these surprises a consequence of the complexity or
					nonlinearity of natural-social systems? Or can they be explained by simpler processes? Our
					research addresses this question for systems composed of lakes, their shoreline (riparian)
					vegetation and land use, and social and economic organizations of lake users. We will
					study the self-organization of lake users and associated characteristics of shoreline and
					lake ecosystems. We will determine whether thresholds in riparian organization set the
					stage for an important class of surprises - collapses of economically important game fish
					stocks. We will test the possibility that nonlinear dynamics can be used to design
					manipulations that remove invading crayfish from a lake. If successful, our experiment
					will cause a self-sustaining removal of an invasive species - a path-breaking ecological
					restoration. </para>
