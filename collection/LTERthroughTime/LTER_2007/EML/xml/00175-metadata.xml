                Data collected on these plots led to the following two publications (1,2) and a
                doctoral thesis (3). Results from the element analysis will be posted seperately on
                this website. Other soils data (soil depth, exchangeable cations, and texture) and
                tree data (species, condition, and for some tree ring increment measures and tree
                height) were also taken on these plots and will also be posted seperately on this
                website.</literalLayout></para></section><section><title>SAMPLING DESIGN</title><para><literalLayout>Paul Schwarz and others collected this data on a subset of the 431
                plots that are located across the entire Hubbard Brook Valley. The following methods
                for establishment of the 431 plots, the selection process for the subset of 260
                plots, and the soil sample collection are excerpted from Schwarz et al 2003, page
                1864 (see below for reference)"Fifteen N&#8211;S transects were established at 500-m
                intervals to span the entire Hubbard Brook Valley (Fig.1). Along the transects, a
                regular array of 431 500-m2 circular plots was established at distance intervals of
                either 25 m, 100 m, or 200 m. The sampling layout and spacing of the plots was
                designed to facilitate the analysis of spatial patterns in the forest vegetation by
                utilizing a wide range of distance intervals between plots (Fortin et al.
                1989)."..."We collected soil samples from a subset of 260 plots that consisted of
                all the plots from every other transect (Fig. 1). Twelve soil cores (2 cm diameter)
                were collected at randomly chosen locations within each plot. The forest &#64258;oor
                material was separated from the mineral soil, and 15cm of mineral soil was retained
                from each core." UTM coordinates of all plots are included in this dataset. A map of
                the plot locations can be found in Schwarz et al 2003 (Fig.1).</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Four cores were taken at three locations in each plot (thus the
                resulting 12 cores per plot); however, some plots have an additional sampling point
                to compensate for very thin mineral soil conditions. Although the subset included
                260 plots, only 257 plots are included in this dataset. The missing data is from
                plot numbers 188, 189, and 346. If a sampling point was not located randomly due to
                sampling constraints in the plot, it is noted in the comments section with an
                explanation.</literalLayout></para></section></description><citation scope="document"><title>Factors controlling spatial variation of tree species abundance in a forested
