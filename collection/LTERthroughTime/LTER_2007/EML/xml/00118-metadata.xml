North Inlet-Winyah Bay features high quality, ocean-dominated waters and salt marshes in North Inlet, contrasting with the brackish waters and marshes of Winyah Bay. The bay estuary is dominated by riverine discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural, municipal and industrial development. Former rice fields  and canals provide another system for study within the Reserve. The Debidue site is located at the confluence of Town Creek and Debidue Creek. The Bread and Butter site is located along the western shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of Clambank Creek.        The number of cores taken at the Debidue site (DD) and the Bread and Butter     site (BB) remained at two from January 20, 1981 (Cruise 1) through January     8, 1985 (Cruise 99).  Starting on January 18, 1985 the Debidue site was     dropped and eight smaller cores were taken at the Bread and Butter site.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-79.2936</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-79.1042</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>33.357</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>33.2125</southBoundingCoordinate></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage id="temporalReference" scope="document"><singleDateTime><calendarDate>1981</calendarDate></singleDateTime></temporalCoverage></coverage><maintenance><description><section><title>Entry verification</title><para><literalLayout>Multiple levels of entry verification were performed.

The same 3 screen system was in use on the IBM PC,     beginning with cruise 169.  Data were uploaded to the mainframe system     after being certified error-free.

Osyurostylis smithi on the old data sheets were     included in the category "cumaceans".  Categories "amphipod" and "isopod"     remained the same in both data formats.

     Sampling was done on the same day as all other LTER fauna sampling except
     when weather conditions, generally east winds that produced higher than
     usual tides, caused delays.  In those cases cores were obtained on the 
     next suitable low tide.  The core size and the depth of the core changed
     over the study period.  All changes are given under Section #36, Research
     Methods.  During most of the first four years of the study, a 20 cm long
     PVC pipe (10.3 cm inside diameter), served as the coring device.  Cores
     were taken to a depth of 15 cm of sediment in 20 cm of water (except when
     noted under #36 Research Methods).
     To determine the depth at which animals occurred in the substrate, cores
     were split into 5 cm depth increments during the period January 20, 1981 -
     January 3, 1984 (Cruises 1-74).  On occasion the substrate was too watery
     to section successfully.  These instances were also noted in Section #36.
     From January 16, 1984 - January 8, 1985 (Cruises 75-99), cores continued 
     to be taken to a depth of 15 cm of sediment but were not split.  To 
     compare data from all years when different volumes of sediment were
     collected and cores were not vertically sectioned into 5 cm increments,
     data were first changed to numbers per m2.  This number was then 
     multiplied by the following factors to equalize data to a number per 5 cm
     depth:

     Starting on January 18, 1985 (Cruise 100), sampling at the Debidue site
     (DD) was suspended.  At the Bread and Butter site (BB) the core size was
     changed to an 18.1 cm2 area and cores were taken only of the top 5 cm of
     sediment.  Eight cores were taken in an effort to increase sampling
     accuracy by decreasing variability between cores.  The total area of
     sediment sampled was similar to that sampled during the previous years.
     The coring device was a 30 cm length of 48 mm inside diameter Plexiglass
     pipe.  A rubber stopper was used to close the upper end of the pipe to
     facilitate core removal.
     Cores were placed directly into Nalgene jars and preserved with a 10 percent 
     buffered formalin-seawater mixture stained with Rose Bengal.  Samples were
     allowed to rest for at least 48 hours in the preservative before being
     sieved through a 0.5 mm mesh screen.  All material retained on the screen
     was washed into small counting dishes and the contents sorted with the aid
     of a dissecting microscope.  All animals were identified to the lowest
     possible category and counted.  Animals separated by taxa were placed in
     storage jars containing a 70 percent  Ethanol solution (stock = 95 percent  ETOH + tap
     water + glycerin, 15:5:1 by volume).  All storage jars were labeled by
     sample with sample date, station (DD or BB), and jar number.  Each jar
     contained a label inside with the above information and the identity of 
     the animals contained.  The jar numbers corresponded to those listed on 
     the original count sheets.  Example: A jar labelled 04/18/81 D1 Top #4
     Spiophanes bombyx contained all Spiophanes bombyx found at Debidue 
     station, Replicate 1, in the top 5 cm of sediment and was the fourth jar 
     in that replicate.  This system allowed ready access to any specimen
     collected.
     Samples for years 1981 through 1984 have been archived and stored in 
     sealed quart jarsand collected in boxes in the preserved samples shedat the field lab.  Samples were indexed by cruise and box.  Index sheets
     were stored 1) with the boxes and 2) in the Research Specialist's office 
     at the field lab.  Original count sheets listed the identities and numbers
     of all animals collected, comments and physical measurements at each site.
     These sheets were stored in fire-proof cabinets.  A second set of data
     sheets used for computer entry were stored separately.  Numbers for each
     cruise were entered shortly after processing on the Full Screen Manager.
     Beginning in May 1986, biomass was determined for selected samples.  
     Three additional cores were collected at the Bread and Butter subtidal
     site.  These cores were processed in the same manner as described above,
     however the preserved animals picked out of the samples were first rinsed
     thoroughly in fresh water and then placed in preweighed aluminum pans.
     These pans were oven-dried at 60 degrees C for 24 hours, or until a
     constant weight had been attained.  These data tracked monthly changes in
     the total biomass of an 18.1 cm square area.  Biomass data on a species
     level was obtained in another manner.  Qualitative samples were collected
     periodically and preserved animals were identified and placed into
     species-specific size classes.  Width of the first setigerous segment of
     polychaetes, in micrometer units at 12X, was used to place polychaetes 
     into size classes (Some of the larger polychaetes were measured at lower
     powers).  The width of the first setigerous segment of Oligochaetes was
     measured at 12X.  The carapace length of amphipods and cumaceans was
     measured at 25X and 12X, respectively.  Isopods and shrimp were measured 
     at 12X while bivalves were measured at the longest anterior-posterior
     dimension at 12X.  Several specimens of each size class of each species
     were placed in preweighed aluminum pans.  Each size class/species pan was
     replicated at least 3 times.  All pans were oven-dried at 60 degree C for
     24 hours or until a constant weight was attained.  An average weight was
     calculated for each size class and pan and for each species a width (or
     length)/weight regression was calculated.  With these regressions, average
     biomass on a species level could be quantitatively determined from the
     biweekly samples by simply measuring the appropriate dimension under the
     microscope and using the regression equation.  The following regression
     equations were obtained for various macrobenthic taxa.  All regressions 
     used natural log(ln)-transformed data and weights were dried weights in mg.
     Size was in ocular micrometer units from the ocular micrometer in the
     macrobenthic dissecting scope.
