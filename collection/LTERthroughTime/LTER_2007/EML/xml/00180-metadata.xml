Unfortunately, history is often not known at the stand level. The purpose of this study is to characterize the stand dynamics and disturbance history of the oak slopes in the Coweeta Basin, a long-term ecological research station located in the southern Appalachian mountains. The basin has a history logging in the early 1900&#65533;s, but remnant old-growth trees remain in the forest. Joyce Kilmer Wilderness area, a wilderness reserve in the same physiographic province as Coweeta, is an old-growth forest with no known logging. It is unknown if remnant old-growth trees provide the same record of disturbance as old-growth trees located in more undisturbed stands. Elliott et al. (1999) described vegetation differences with changes in topography and moisture at Coweeta, but it is unclear whether these changes correspond to different disturbance histories along those gradients. My specific objectives are to determine the disturbance history of seven stands in the Coweeta basin, determine if stands along topographic or compositional gradients in Coweeta have different disturbance histories (e.g. frequency, intensity and origin), establish the disturbance history in two old-growth stands in Joyce Kilmer Wilderness and compare the similarities and differences of the stands in Coweeta and Joyce Kilmer. Stand selection was based on preliminary dating of several large trees per stand, species composition and history. Prism sampling (2.0 BAF, metric) was done at five to ten points in each stand to characterize stand composition and structure. Sixty to 80 increment cores per stand were taken to the pith at 1 meter from the ground parallel to topographic contours to reduce effects of tension wood. Cores were stored in straws until transported to the lab. In the lab, cores were air dried, mounted, and sanded using progressively finer sandpaper in preparation for analysis. Once prepared, cores will be examined and ring widths measured to the nearest 0.01 mm with a dissecting microscope, Velmex sliding stage and J2X software. Cores will be visually cross-dated within species and stands using marker years and then checked with the computer cross-dating program COFECHA. Stand characteristics, such as age structure and species distribution, will be evaluated and compared. Disturbance chronologies will be created and compared for each stand and species using multivariate analysis and Mantel tests. Ring widths and disturbance chronologies are expected to reveal past disturbances in the stands. A disturbance is detected by large, abrupt and sustained releases in the ring widths, as well as well-defined cohorts. By comparing the chronologies, inferences can be made regarding the effect of topographic and compositional gradients on disturbance history.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Coweeta</keyword><keyword>LTER</keyword><keyword>forest disturbance</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Must adhere to the Coweeta LTER Data Policy (See http://coweeta.uga.edu/policies/data).</para></intellectualRights><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://coweeta.uga.edu/summaries/Csummary4039_b.html</url></online></distribution><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>Coweeta Basin Joyce Kilmer Wilderness</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate /><eastBoundingCoordinate /><northBoundingCoordinate /><southBoundingCoordinate /></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2003-08-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2005-12-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><positionName>Coweeta LTER Information Manager</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(828) 524-2128</phone></contact><project scope="document"><title>Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Ted</givenName><surName>Gragson</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>tgragson@earthlink.net</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>James</givenName><surName>Vose</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>jvose@fs.fed.us</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Brian</givenName><surName>Kloeppel</surName></individualName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute of Ecology</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>University of Georgia</deliveryPoint><city>Athens</city><administrativeArea>Georgia</administrativeArea><postalCode>30602</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><electronicMailAddress>kloeppel@uga.edu</electronicMailAddress><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para>The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance

and environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying

watershed ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. 

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific

understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of

land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the

last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years.  This will

be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of

land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental

gradients and natural disturbance regimes.  The result will be a more

complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian

Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of

its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in

response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences

that cascade through ecosystems.  The research activities are organized

into three initiatives: (1) Characterization of the Socio-Natural Template,

(2) Ecosystem Responses to the Socio-Natural Template, and (3) Forecasting

Ecosystem Responses to Changes in the Socio-Natural Template.  The

integrated scientific research will provide both a description as well as

an explanation of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of

land-use change for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society.  It thus

recognizes the complexity of land use as a process and the research needs

as defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific community.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation.
