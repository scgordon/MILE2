The purpose of this network is to address concerns in regional water quality which cross and overlap separate political boundaries. Funding has come from different sources with individual programs being added as funding became available. Biscayne Bay, Florida Bay, Whitewater Bay, Ten Thousand Islands, Rookery Bay, Estero Bay, andPine Island Sound are sampled monthly while the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) and the southwest shelf are sampled quarterly. Variables currently being measured include surface and bottom temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, total nitrogen, total organic nitrogen, total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, total organic carbon, total silicate, chlorophyll a, alkaline phosphatase activity, turbidity, and light extinction. The purpose of this network is to address concerns in regional water quality which cross and overlap separate political boundaries. One of the products is a quasi-synoptic big picture of nutrient and phytoplankton biomass distributions over the South Florida Coastal Waters. The SERC network will, in time, provide us with the data necessary to determine whether conditions within the estuaries and sanctuary are improving or declining.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>aquatic</keyword><keyword>chemistry</keyword><keyword>freshwater</keyword><keyword>marine</keyword><keyword>nutrients</keyword><keyword>organic</keyword><keyword>phosphorus</keyword><keyword>salinity</keyword><keyword>nitrogen</keyword><keyword>estuary</keyword><keyword>saltwater</keyword><keyword>surface water</keyword><keyword>water chemistry</keyword><keyword>water quality</keyword><keyword>Florida Bay</keyword><keyword>Whitewater Bay</keyword><keyword>Everglades National Park</keyword><keyword>Florida</keyword><keyword>1989</keyword><keyword>2007</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>Data from the SERC-FIU WQMN are freely available for academic, research, or professional purposes subject to the following user terms: 1.

Salinity and temperature (degrees C) were measured 10 cm below the surface and 10 cm above the bottom using a combination salinity-conductivity-temperature probe (Orion model 140). Surface and bottom dissolved oxygen (DO, mg l-1) was measured using an oxygen electrode (Orion model 840), corrected for both salinity and temperature. Duplicate, unfiltered water samples were collected from 10 cm below the surface using sample rinsed, 120 ml HDPE bottles and kept at ambient temperature in the dark during transport. Duplicate water samples for dissolved nutrient analysis were collected using sample rinsed 150 ml syringes. These samples were filtered by hand (25 mm glass fiber GF/F) into acetone-washed and sample rinsed 60 ml HDPE bottles, which were then capped and immediately placed on ice in the dark for transport. The wet filters, used for chlorophyll a analysis (CHLA), were placed in 2 ml plastic centrifuge tubes to which 1.5 ml of 90% acetone was added. They were then immediately capped and put into a dark bottle on ice for transport. Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH&lt;2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples. TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. The APA assay measures the activity of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme used by bacteria to mineralize phosphate from organic compounds. The assay is performed by adding a knownconcentration of an organic phosphate compound (o-methylfluorescein phosphate) to an unfiltered water sample. Alkaline phosphatase in the water sample cleaves the phosphate, leaving o-methylfluorescein, a highly fluorescent compound. The fluorescence of initial and 2 hr incubations were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV spectrofluorometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm) and subtracted to give APA (uM h-1). Turbidity was measured using an HF Scientific model DRT-15C turbidimeter and reported in NTU. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOx), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). Filters for CHLA content (&#181;g l-1) were allowed to extract for a minimum of 2 days at -20degrees C before analysis. Extracts were analyzed using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrofluorometer (excitation = 435 nm, emission = 667 nm) and compared to a standard curve of pure CHLA (Sigma). Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in units of milligrams per liter (mg l-1) or the equivalent parts per million (ppm), except where noted. All nutrient concentrations are based on the atomic weight of primary nutrient species (ppm-N, ppm-P, and ppm-C), not the molecular weight. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis.</para></description><citation scope="document"><title>Annual Report of the South Florida Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Network,

This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.</para></abstract><funding><para>National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514</para></funding><studyAreaDescription><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><geographicDescription>The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these "upside-down" estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is:  In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.  Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

The network includes monthly sampling at stations in Rookery Bay, Estero Bay, Pine Island Sound, Florida Bay, Whitewater Bay, the Shark Slough estuaries, Biscayne Bay, Southwest Florida Shelf, and the Ten Thousand Islands.  Florida International University shall provide a Quality Assurance (QA) Program for the network to ensure that the data generated are accurate, representative of actual conditions, and that a quantifiable measure of confidence can be established.</para></abstract><funding><para>This work was supported by the South Florida Water Management District (Contract #C10244) and data are also

Environmental Research Center at FIU.  Although these data were not collected using FCE LTER funding, the data are collected at or near the FCE LTER Research sites.  These data are invaluable and are an important addition to the long-term water quality monitoring efforts being conducted by the FCE LTER.  These WQMN data are not directly submitted to the FCE Information Manager, but are instead, downloaded by the FCE Information Manager from the following website: http://serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork/SFWMD-CD/index.htm. Changes have been made to the original data file as follows:
1) ZSI, ZONE, %SAT_T, %SAT_B, DOS-EX and DOB-EX Sampling Parameters have been deleted as per the Data Set Originator, Dr. Joe Boyer. Additionally, the following parameters were also deleted as the dataset also included a 'DATE' Column: MO, MON, YEAR and YR-MO.
2)  The original dataset included numerous sampling stations but this file only includes WQMN data that were collected near or at FCE LTER Research Sites.  Those WQMN stations are STATION 9-Duck Key, STATION 10-Joe Bay, STATION 11-L. Madeira Bay, STATION 21-Porpoise Lake, STATION 27- Sprigger Bank, STATION 38- Tarpon Bay, STATION 39- Gunboat Island, STATION 40-Ponce De Leon Bay and STATION 41- Oyster Bay.
3) The missing data is represented by 'BLANKS' as opposed to the normal FCE missing data code of -9999 due to 
the numerous missing data values in the dataset.
4) Deleted SURV 91.0 and 176.0 for the above listed stations as there were no dates, times or data values given.  Deleted a total of 8 lines.</notes></datasetInfoManagementNotes></additionalDataset></additionalMetadata></eml:eml>
