		<abstract>
			<para>Benthic invertebrate assemblages of 32 lakes were surveyed as part of the Landscape
				Position Project. We used modified Hester-Dendy colonization substrates to sample benthic
				invertebrate communities. Each sampling device consisted of a 3"x3" top plate, alternating
				layers of course and fine mesh, a ''choreboy'' commercial scrubbing puff, alternating layers
				of coarse (6.35 mm) and fine (3.18 mm) black plastic mesh, and a 3"x3" bottom plate. Two
				Hester-Dendy samplers were set at a depth of one meter on each of three substrate types
				(cobble, sand and silt) within each lake for four weeks in late June through late July in
				either 1998 or 1999. Within each lake, areas of different substrate types were identified
				using WI-DNR depth contour lake maps, and substrate type was verified by direct observation.
				Different substrates were sampled to account for invertebrate associations with specific
				substrate characteristics. Lake order was determined using a modification of the method of
				Riera et al. (2000). Lake order is a numerical surrogate for groundwater influx and
				hydrological position along a drainage network, with the highest number indicating the lake
				lowest in a watershed. Riera, Joan L., John J. Magnuson, Tim K. Kratz, and Katherine E.
				Webster. 2000. A geomorphic template for the analysis of lake districts applied to Northern
				Highland Lake District, Wisconsin, U.S.A. Freshwater Biology 43:301-18. Sampling Frequency:
				one survey on each lake in late June through late July of 1998 or 1999 Number of sites: 32

			<abstract>
				<para>The importance of the position of a lake in the landscape relative to hydrologic flow
					has been a focus of the Long-Term Ecological Research Project, based at the UW-Madison
					Center for Limnology, for almost two decades. We have found that there are strong patterns
					in water chemistry, primary productivity, and morphology driven by ground and surface
					water inputs (Magnuson et. al. 1990, Kratz et al. 1997, Riera et al. in press). Also, lake
					size and physico-chemical conditions within a lake have been shown to influence community
					structure in fishes (Tonn and Magnuson 1982, Tonn et al.1990). However, we know much less
					about how landscape level traits, such as surface water connections, influence biotic
					diversity and community structure within lakes and whether the species pool changes across
					watersheds of North-Central Wisconsin (Hrabik and Magnuson 1999). The primary goal of our
					project is to conduct field experiments that contrast lake chemical and geographical
					properties and explore the role of those properties in shaping biotic diversity and
					community structure. </para>

					<geographicDescription>Location: Crystal Lake is located within the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest, Vilas County.
It is a seepage lake with predominantly sand substrate. It has a surface area of 36.7 hectare, 2.3 kilometers of highly developed shoreline and a maximum depth of 20.4 meters.
Crystal Lake represents one extreme in the groundwater input gradient, with a marked predominance of precipitation inputs. Groundwater accounts for only 5% of input water, yet, because groundwater is more concentrated chemically than precipitation, groundwater accounts for substantial amounts of incoming solutes. For example, about 50% of the silica budget comes into the lake via groundwater, exerting a major influence on primary production.
The lake is an oligotrophic, dimictic lake high in the landscape with minimal groundwater input, a light attenuation coefficient of 0.24 per meter (average ice-free Secchi depth of 8 m), a mean depth of 11.4 m, and a maximum depth of 20.4 m. Crystal Lake is circular with a shoreline development factor very close to 1.0. The littoral zone is fairly homogenous and is dominated by sandy substrate with low macrophyte and coarse woody habitat densities. The fish community has been historically dominated by pelagic yellow perch. However, yellow perch drastically declined after the detection of rainbow smelt in 1985.
