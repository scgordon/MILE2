			<para>Data collected by Birge, Juday, and collaborators, mostly in north-central Wisconsin,
				from 1900 through 1943; generally one sampling event per lake during the summer, &#194;&#160;but on
				some lakes, especially around Trout Lake Station, several sampling events for several
				successive years. This data set contains both surface data (depth of zero) and multi-depth
				data. Note that not all variables were measured on all lakes. Documentation: Johnson, M.D.
				(1984) Documentation and quality assurance of the computer files of historical water
				chemistry data from the Wisconsin Northern Highland Lake District (the Birge and Juday
				data).Wisconsin DNR Technical Report. Note: Values of -99999 in water quality data indicate
				trace amount of parameter was present. Number of sites: 663 (generally one sampling point
				per lake; occasionally, several sampling points per lake on multibasin, large lakes).&#194;&#160;Note:
				This data set was updated in 2013 to include multi-depth and additional surface data for a
				large subset of lakes. These additions expanded the number of sites from 605 to 663, and
				expanded the date range from 1925-1942 to 1900-1943 . Furthermore, 14 lakes in Minnesota
				were added to the data set contributing additional surface and multi-depth data.&#194;&#160; Another
				dataset was added in 2013 collected by Wisconsin limnologists Chauncey Juday and Edward
				Birge, this data set contains variables that are still commonly used in research. For
				example, temperature, dissolved carbon dioxide, color, pH, secchi disk, plankton, and
				silica. However, the data set also includes variables that are not commonly used, for
				example, crude protein, non-amino nitrogen, ether extract, and total organic and inorganic
				material. These data are characteristic of water chemistry analysis from the time in which
				they were compiled (5/31/1915 - 8/29/1938). The data set features data from 586 different
				lakes, primarily lakes in the Northern Highland Lakes District of Wisconsin. However, there
				is also data from lakes in southeastern and southcentral Wisconsin. Furthermore, there is a
				minimal amount of data &#194;&#160;from lakes in Minnesota, Ohio,New York, Alaska, the Philippines, and
				the United Kingdom. Documentation:Birge, E.A., and Juday, C. 1922. The inland lakes of
				Wisconsin. The Plankton I. Its quantity and chemical composition. Bulletin, Wis. Geol. and

				<geographicDescription>The majority of the data represents sites sampled in the Northern Highland Lakes District of Wisconsin. However, there is also data from Wisconsin located in Waupaca, Waukesha, and Dane counties. The Minnesota lakes featured in the database are from northern Minnesota, including lakes in Itasca, Beltrami, Anoka, Cass, Hennepin, St. Louis, Cook, and Lake counties. Data from lakes in New York was collected from only three lakes near Syracuse and Rochester, New York. Buckeye Lake, located in Licking County, is the only Ohio lake in this data set. &#194;&#160;Data from all lakes, rivers, and creeks in Alaska was collected on Kodiac Island. Lake data from the United Kingdom was compiled from lakes and reservoirs across the country, ten in total. Finally, there is data from four lakes in the Philippines, which are located south of Manila near San Pablo City.

				<para>North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research studies the ecology of lakes as
					one of a network of sites established by the National Science Foundation. We are
					interested in how biophysical setting, climate, and changing land use and cover interact
					to shape lake characteristics and dynamics over time (past, present, future). Our primary
					study sites include a set of seven northern Wisconsin and four southern Wisconsin lakes
					and their surrounding landscapes. The project, which started in 1981, is administered by
					the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Perception of Long-Term
					Change: How and why have the lake districts changed, and how will they change in the
					future? Climatic Forcing of Change: What are the major ecological and social responses of
					lake districts to climate change? Interacting Drivers, Scales of Space and Time, and
					Regional Change: How do multiple interacting drivers affect regional change in lake
					districts at multiple scales? Ecosystem Services: Past, Present and Future: What are the
					magnitudes, interactions and potential future flows of ecosystem services in lake
					districts? </para>

					<geographicDescription>Location: Crystal Bog is located within the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest, Vilas County.
It is a small and shallow bog lake. It has a surface area of 0.5 hectare, mostly undeveloped shoreline and a maximum depth of 2.5 meters.
Bog lakes are isolated to a large extent from surrounding groundwater flow systems. However, they exhibit a similar pattern, across landscapes, to that exhibited by other lakes in general. The proportional input of groundwater to the bogs' hydrologic inputs increases with decreasing elevation in the landscape. More detailed studies of Crystal Bog reveal a complex interplay between conditions in the lake and in the surrounding wetland due to the groundwater flow regime and resulting chemical transfers.

					<geographicDescription>Location: Crystal Lake is located within the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest, Vilas County.
It is a seepage lake with predominantly sand substrate. It has a surface area of 36.7 hectare, 2.3 kilometers of mostly undeveloped (campground) developed shoreline and a maximum depth of 20.4 meters.
Crystal Lake represents one extreme in the groundwater input gradient, with a marked predominance of precipitation inputs. Groundwater accounts for only 5% of input water, yet, because groundwater is more concentrated chemically than precipitation, groundwater accounts for substantial amounts of incoming solutes. For example, about 50% of the silica budget comes into the lake via groundwater, exerting a major influence on primary production.
The lake is an oligotrophic, dimictic lake high in the landscape with minimal groundwater input, a light attenuation coefficient of 0.24 per meter (average ice-free Secchi depth of 8 m), a mean depth of 11.4 m, and a maximum depth of 20.4 m. Crystal Lake is circular with a shoreline development factor very close to 1.0. The littoral zone is fairly homogenous and is dominated by sandy substrate with low macrophyte and coarse woody habitat densities. The fish community has been historically dominated by pelagic yellow perch. However, yellow perch drastically declined after the detection of rainbow smelt in 1985.

					<geographicDescription>Location: Crystal Bog is located within the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest, Vilas County.
It is a small and shallow bog lake. It has a surface area of 0.5 hectare, mostly undeveloped shoreline and a maximum depth of 2.5 meters.
Bog lakes are isolated to a large extent from surrounding groundwater flow systems. However, they exhibit a similar pattern, across landscapes, to that exhibited by other lakes in general. The proportional input of groundwater to the bogs' hydrologic inputs increases with decreasing elevation in the landscape. More detailed studies of Crystal Bog reveal a complex interplay between conditions in the lake and in the surrounding wetland due to the groundwater flow regime and resulting chemical transfers.

					<geographicDescription>Location: Crystal Lake is located within the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest, Vilas County.
It is a seepage lake with predominantly sand substrate. It has a surface area of 36.7 hectare, 2.3 kilometers of mostly undeveloped (campground) developed shoreline and a maximum depth of 20.4 meters.
Crystal Lake represents one extreme in the groundwater input gradient, with a marked predominance of precipitation inputs. Groundwater accounts for only 5% of input water, yet, because groundwater is more concentrated chemically than precipitation, groundwater accounts for substantial amounts of incoming solutes. For example, about 50% of the silica budget comes into the lake via groundwater, exerting a major influence on primary production.
The lake is an oligotrophic, dimictic lake high in the landscape with minimal groundwater input, a light attenuation coefficient of 0.24 per meter (average ice-free Secchi depth of 8 m), a mean depth of 11.4 m, and a maximum depth of 20.4 m. Crystal Lake is circular with a shoreline development factor very close to 1.0. The littoral zone is fairly homogenous and is dominated by sandy substrate with low macrophyte and coarse woody habitat densities. The fish community has been historically dominated by pelagic yellow perch. However, yellow perch drastically declined after the detection of rainbow smelt in 1985.
