		<abstract>
			<para>Microbial community composition is inferred by a combination of automated ribosomal
				intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and PCR-generated clone library analysis. Clone libraries
				include both the 16S rRNA gene and the 16S-23S ribosomal intergenic spacer fragment.
				Phylogenetic assignments for individual ARISA fragments are obtained by comparing the ARISA
				fragment length from each clone to all of the profiles stored in our database. We have
				analyzed over 3900 clones obtained from 41 lakes that represent the range of trophic types
				found in temperate landscapes. Querying by taxonomic characteristics of the clone allows the
				user to retrieve clone IDs, sequence data, and characteristics of the sequence (length,
				chimera status, accession number, taxonomic affiliation). The data can be filtered by clone
				ID, ARISA fragment length (raw or binned), and/or taxonomic characteristics (Phylum and
				Phylum-Class). The output includes links to individual clone records, which contain more
				detailed information about how the clone was generated (researcher, library ID, project ID,
				primer sets used, etc.). </para>

				<para>Our primary goal in the Microbial Observatory is to advance the understanding of lake

					<geographicDescription>Location: Crystal Bog is located within the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest, Vilas County.
It is a small and shallow bog lake. It has a surface area of 0.5 hectare, mostly undeveloped shoreline and a maximum depth of 2.5 meters.
Bog lakes are isolated to a large extent from surrounding groundwater flow systems. However, they exhibit a similar pattern, across landscapes, to that exhibited by other lakes in general. The proportional input of groundwater to the bogs' hydrologic inputs increases with decreasing elevation in the landscape. More detailed studies of Crystal Bog reveal a complex interplay between conditions in the lake and in the surrounding wetland due to the groundwater flow regime and resulting chemical transfers.

					<geographicDescription>Location: Crystal Lake is located within the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest, Vilas County.
It is a seepage lake with predominantly sand substrate. It has a surface area of 36.7 hectare, 2.3 kilometers of highly developed shoreline and a maximum depth of 20.4 meters.
Crystal Lake represents one extreme in the groundwater input gradient, with a marked predominance of precipitation inputs. Groundwater accounts for only 5% of input water, yet, because groundwater is more concentrated chemically than precipitation, groundwater accounts for substantial amounts of incoming solutes. For example, about 50% of the silica budget comes into the lake via groundwater, exerting a major influence on primary production.
The lake is an oligotrophic, dimictic lake high in the landscape with minimal groundwater input, a light attenuation coefficient of 0.24 per meter (average ice-free Secchi depth of 8 m), a mean depth of 11.4 m, and a maximum depth of 20.4 m. Crystal Lake is circular with a shoreline development factor very close to 1.0. The littoral zone is fairly homogenous and is dominated by sandy substrate with low macrophyte and coarse woody habitat densities. The fish community has been historically dominated by pelagic yellow perch. However, yellow perch drastically declined after the detection of rainbow smelt in 1985.
