	<abstract>
		<para>This experiment was designed to determine the relationships between plant traits, successional status, and resource reduction for five grass species that were grown for three years in monoculture in replicated field plots on soils prepared to have different availabilities of nitrogen. It also determines the results of competition experiments among various combinations of these species as well as the differing feedback effects of each species on soil nitrogen mineralization rates. All of this work has motivated the desire to more fully understand the mechanisms of interactions among plants and their resources, in the belief that this might eventually allow predictions of the dynamics, diversity, and composition of plant communities.</para>

								<para>The five grass species we used are common prairie, grassland and old field species but differ in their successional status (Tilman 1988) and their response to nutrient addition (Tilman 1987). They are the five most abundant grasses during old field succession at Cedar Creek Natural History Area (CCNHA), where this work was performed. Agrostis scabra Willd. (a native bentgrass) and Agropyron repens (L. ) Beauv. (quack grass, introduced from Europe) are both early successional species at CCNHA. Poa pratensis L. (Kentucky bluegrass, introduced) dominates mid-successional fields at CCNHA. Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx. ) Nash-Gould (little bluestem, formerly Andropogon scoparius Michx. ) and Andropogon gerardi Vitm. (big bluestem) are native prairie species that dominate older successional fields at CCNHA. For brevity, we will refer to each species by its genus.</para>

								<para>This research was performed in an experimental garden at CCNHA, which is located on a large glacial outwash sandplain in Isanti and Anoka counties of Minnesota. Each species was grown in both monoculture and mixed species plots across a range of total soil nitrogens. In August, 1985, we used a bulldozer to remove the upper 60 to 80 cm of soil from a 3 m x 34m area of a 25 yr old field, thus exposing subsurface sand. This substrate was 93% sand, 3% clay, and 4% silt, had a pH of 6.6, contained 0.3% organic matter and had a total soil nitrogen, as N, of 90 mg/kg of soil. This area was divided into ten regions, 3 m x 12 m each, with 1 m walkways between them. Each of the ten regions was randomly assigned to be one of ten different soil mixtures. Nine of the soil mixtures were established by adding an amount of top soil per plot such that, once top soil and subsurface sand had been mixed to a depth of 22 cm, top soil would comprise approximately 0% (soil mixture 1), 10%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 55%, 70%, 90% or 100% (soil mixture 9) of the upper 22 cm of soil in the plot. To keep the surface of all soil mixtures level with their surroundings, the sand in each was excavated to a depth equal to the amount of top soil to be added. Soil mixture 10 was a duplicate of the 100% top soil treatment, but also received 6.55 g/m2/yr of additional N as NH4NO3. This was added monthly in proportion to normal N mineralization at Cedar Creek (Pastor et al. 1987; April = 9%, May = 33%, June = 28%, July = 15%, August = 17%). After top soil was added, each plot was thoroughly rototilled twice. This resulted in a uniform, 22 cm deep layer of soil that was underlain by unmixed sand. Approximately 60 m3 of top soil were used. This soil, obtained off-site, was a Duelm sandy loam of the Hubbard-Isanti-Duelm Association. It averaged 72% sand, 4% clay, and 24% silt, had 2.9% organic matter, total soil N of about 1200 mg/kg, and a pH of 7.2. It was chosen because it was a sandy outwash soil with total soil nitrogen content similar to that of undisturbed upland soils at CCNHA. 
 
To assure that no nutrients other than N would be limiting, we analyzed the soils, and based on these analyses, added 5.6 g/m2 of P, 8.9 g/m2 of K, 42 g/m2 of MgSO4, 8 g/m2 of Ca, 0.68 g/m2 of Zn, 0.28 g/m2 of Cu, 0.11 g/m2 of B, and 0.19 g/m2 of Mn in April 1986. These nutrients were thoroughly rototilled, to a depth of 22cm, into all plots. These nutrients were also added to the soil surface in subsequent years. Soil pH was stable, at 7.2, in all plots except the pure sand mixture and the 10% top soil mixture which received fine ground commercial lime in 1987 and 1988 to adjust their pH to 7.2. All plots were watered to receive at least 1.5 cm/wk in April, May, and October, and 2.5 cm/wk in June through September. </para>

								<para>In April, 1986, galvanized sheet metal (26 gauge) was used to divide each of the 10 soil mixtures into 64 experimental plots, each of which was 0.75 m x 0.75 m. To do this, the sheet metal, which was 25 cm tall, was driven into the soil to a depth of 23 cm. The entire garden was then fenced to a height of 2 m and to a depth of 1.3 m belowground to exclude all mammalian herbivores. Seeds of Agrostis, Agropyron, Poa, Schizachyrium and Andropogon were planted in the monoculture plots in late May, 1986, at a density, based on germination trials, to yield 3000 seedlings/m2. Seeds were covered with 0.5 cm of sand. There were 2 replicate monocultures of Andropogon, 3 replicate monocultures of Poa and Schizachyrium, and 4 replicate monocultures of Agrostis and Agropyron for each soil mixture, giving a total of 160 monoculture plots. This design was caused by limited space and the need for a balance between monocultures and competition plots in the various competition experiments that were performed simultaneously in these gardens. Monoculture and competition treatments were randomly assigned to the 64 plots within a soil mixture, with each soil mixture being independently randomized.

								<para>All plots receive at least 1.5cm/week of water in April, May and October and 2.5cm/week in June through September. If the plots receive this water from natural rainfall, then no supplemental watering is needed. When watering is needed, it is done using a system of hoses set up in the field. A black irrigation pipe, 3 inches in diameter, is hooked up to the pump. This extends out to the E026 area where the 3-inch hose is divided into two 2-inch hoses. One part goes toward the E026 (and E071) plots (the other toward E055, E069, E070). From this hose, several regular garden hoses are connected. Gardena Excellent Oscillating Sprinklers, model 6968, are attached to these hoses. These sprinklers are purchased at Sears and made at Gardena, Inc., 6031 Culligan Way, Minnetonka, MN 55345. Three or four hoses/sprinklers are used at one time. Any more than this reduces the water pressure enough so the sprinklers will not work. The sprinklers are moved in order to reach all of the plots.</para>

								<para>From 1982 to 1988, light meter readings were taken using a Li-Cor, Inc. Integrating Quantum/Radiometer/Photometer, model LI-188B. Two people were needed to take light readings with this system. One would hold the control box and record data and the other would hold the light sensor. The batteries would be checked before starting each session. If the batteries were OK, they would proceed to take readings. The sensor was connected to the control box by a relatively short cord, so the two people taking readings were required to stay close together. When taking readings, it was necessary to get a range value for each light value entered. If the integrating time of 1 second was not sufficient, it was increased to 10 seconds. This was also recorded. 
 
In 1989, two new light meters were acquired. These are SF Sunfleck Ceptometers, model SF-40 (40cm probe). They were purchased from Decagon Devices, Inc., P.O. Box 835, Pullman, WA 99163. One person can easily handle a ceptometer alone. This makes is possible for three people to get the readings done more quickly and easily. One person records data while the other two take readings from the plots simultaneously. No range values are needed. To take readings a person needs to select function #1 (PAR readings), position the probe (see below) and press ``A' (read value). More than one reading can be taken and then averaged by pressing a certain sequence of letters (A, A, B, B, A). 
 
Measurements are taken within a 4 hour period, 2 hours on either side of solar noon. (Solar noon is half way between sunrise and sunset; it is not 1200 hours). Solar noon is at 1315 hours, Central Daylight Time. Samples are taken between 1115 hours and 1515 hours. Measurements are not taken when the plot being sampled is shaded. Light readings are done when the sky is clear, whenever possible. If a cloud passes over the plot being sampled, assistants wait for the cloud to pass before taking the readings. If the sky is mostly cloudy, light meter readings are not taken. 
 
Two measurements are taken in each plot. Each measurement consists of one reading above the vegetation and a second reading at ground level. Both values are taken to get the percent of sunlight above the vegetation that reaches ground level. In taking the above vegetation reading, the sensor must be kept level, held high above all vegetation, kept out of the shade (of plants and people) and it must be clean. When taking the below vegetation reading, at ground level, the sensor must be kept level, out of the soil and out of the shade created by people. 
 
In 1991, light meter readings were only taken in E026 and E055. Light profiles were taken using an A-shaped frame made of aluminum. Wires were strung across the frame at 10cm intervals. The frame was placed over the subplot being metered. A reading was taken over the top of the frame, and then at each 10cm level, by placing the light meter across the wires, starting at 90cm above the ground. Readings were taken every 10cm down the frame and again at ground level. 
Light Data Transformations: 
Light readings are transformed to obtain percent light penetration which represents the percent of light above the vegetation that reaches the ground surface. In cases where the experiment involves shading, another variable is computed to reflect the percent of sun light that reaches above the canopy. This variable is called light available. In the case of absence of artificial shades, the latter is set to 1. 
 
percent light penetration = ( Light below canopy / Light above canopy ). 
 
percent light available = ( Light below shade / Light above shade ).</para>

								<para>E026 was sampled on an annual basis from 1986-1990. Each plot was sampled each year. A 7.8 x 55cm strip was clipped at the soil surface during August 28 - September 12 1986. The same size strip was harvested during July 25-August 5 1987. A 10 x 40cm strip was clipped during July 13-27 1988. These three strips were located at least 10cm from a plot edge in an area that had not been previously clipped. Sampling dates were chosen based on phenology, to be near the time of peak Agrostis flowering. 
 
Vegetation was sampled using the same clippers as described in above ground vegetation sampling methods except in 1986 when a hand-held clipper with a more narrow blade was used. Since the clip strips were so small, new metal frames were made to aid in clipping instead of using the 3m long aluminum poles. The metal frames were made so that after setting the frame down on the subplot, all the clipper needed to do was clip between the two edges of the frame. The distance from the edge of the subplot and the length of the strip were already set due to the frame shape.</para>

Experiments 5, 6, 28, 36,53,97, 98 and 100 are conducted within plots that are fertilized and should be treated as part of the fertilized plot.  There are nine treatment levels, assigned a letter A through I. This is also equivalent to the numeric labels 1 to 9. Treatment levels A through H differ in the amount of NH4NO3 added. Treatment I is a true control and receives no nutrients. The nutrients are applied twice a year, once in early May and once in late June. An exception is experiment 25 where time of application is experimentally manipulated. Not all experiments  use all possible treatments. Nutrients are given in g/m2 for each fertilization; plot area and treatments used follow the nutrient lists.

Rate  	Volume  	Element 
10 g/m2  	150 ml  	P2O5 (0-46-0) 
10 g/m2  	150 ml  	K2O (0-0-61) 
20 g/m2  	200 ml  	CaCO3 (lime) 
15m2  	200 ml  	MgSO4 (Epsom Salts) 
0.0625 ml/m2  	trace mineral solution in 1 ml to 10 ml sand	 	 	 
 
The description for making trace mineral sand is at the end of this section. 
 
The amount of NH4NO3 fertilizer added at the different treatment levels is: 
	 	 	 
Treatment  	Rate  	Volume 
A  	0.0 g/m2  	0 ml 
B  	1.5 g/m2  	25 ml 
C  	3.0 g/m2  	50 ml 
D  	5.0 g/m2  	90 ml 
E  	8.0 g/m2  	140 ml 
F  	14.0 g/m2  	250 ml 
G  	25.0 g/m2  	445 ml 
H  	40.0 g/m2  	710 ml 
I  	0.0 g/m2  	0 ml	 	 	 
 
These rates are added twice a year. Actual annual N addition is calculated as: 
 
0.34%N * rate (g/m2) * 2 times/year 
 
The trace mineral stock solutions are made by adding the following grams of reagent to 1000 ml of water: 
 
CuSO4*5H2O 9.8 g 
ZnSO4*7H2O 22.0 g 
or 
ZnCl2 10.5 g 
CoCl2*6H2O 10.0 g 
MnCl2*4H2O 180.0 g 
Na2MoO4*2H2O 6.3 g 
H3BO3 6.0 g 
 
The trace metal solution is made by combining 120ml of each stock solution, adding 67.2g of citric acid dissolved in deionized water and adding deionized water to bring the volume to a total of 2 liters. The working solution is then autoclaved to chelate the trace metals.

Treatments in the Competition Garden 
 
The following treatments are found in each of the ten different soil types. 
 
Each plot (soil type) contains 64 subplots: 
 
Species: 
 
100 Ar = Agropyron repens, seed from Roseau, MN 
 
117 Pp = Poa pratensis, seed collected at CCNHA 
 
103 Ss = Schizachyrium scoparium, seed from Crex Meadows, WI; harvested 
 
by Prairie Rest, Inc 
 
098 ArCCNHA = Agropyron repens, seed from CCNHA 
 
102 Ag = Andropogon gerardii, seed from PRI 
 
101 As = Agrostis scabra, seed from CCNHA 
 
Types of plots: 
 
Dewit = Plots are seeded at the same time with the ratio of the two species changing while the total density remains constant. 
 
Mono = Monoculture 
 
SeedInv. = Seed of a second species is sown into a high density stand of the first species which has grown for a year. 
 
Est.Inv. = Each subplot is divided into four units, two of whish are planted at high density with one species, two with the other species. After the first season the barriers seperating the four units will be removed. 
 
Total density: 
 
The values given are the estimated number of germinating plants per square meter; the actual germination rates for the differents species in the different treatments are available elsewhere. Since the subplots are .75 X .&amp;% meters, their actual area is .5625 m2.
