						<para>Inorganic and organic carbon Samples for inorganic and organic carbon are
							collected together with a peristaltic pump and tubing and in-line filtered, if
							necessary, (through a 0.40 micron polycarbonate filter) into glass, 24 ml vials (that
							are compatible with the carbon analyzer autosampler), and capped with septa, leaving
							no head space. The samples are stored refrigerated at 4 degrees Celsius until
							analysis, which should occur within 2-3 weeks. The detection limit for inorganic
							carbon is 0.15 ppm, and the analytical range for the method is 60 ppm. The detection
							limit for organic carbon is 0.30 ppm and the analytical range for the method is 30
							ppm. Method Log: Prior to May 2006 samples, inorganic carbon was analyzed by
							phosphoric acid addition on an OI Model 700 Carbon Analyzer. From May 2006 to present,
							inorganic carbon is still analyzed by phosphoric acid addition, but on a Shimadzu
							TOC-V-csh Total Organic Carbon Analyzer. Method Log: Prior to May 2006 samples,
							organic carbon was analyzed by heated persulfate digestion on an OI Model 700 Carbon
							Analyzer. From May 2006 to present, Organic carbon is analyzed by combustion, on a
							Shimadzu TOC-V-csh Total Organic Carbon Analyzer. Dissolved reactive silicon Samples
							for silicon are collected with a peristaltic pump and tubing and in-line filtered
							(through a 40 micron polycarbonate filter) into 120 ml LDPE bottles and acidified to a
							1percent HCl matrix by adding 1 ml of ultra pure concentrated HCl to 100 mls of
							sample. For every sample acidification event, three acid blanks are created by adding
							the same acid used on the samples to 100 mls of ultra pure water supplied from the
							lab. Once acidified, the samples are stable at room temperature until analysis, which
							should occur within one year. Until acidification, the samples should be refrigerated
							at 4 degrees Celsius. Dissolved reactive silica is determined by the Heteropoly Blue
							Method and the absorption is measured at 820 nm. The detection limit for silicon is 6
							ppb and the analytical range is 15000 ppb. Method Log These determinations were
							performed manually using a Bausch and Lomb Spectrophotometer from the beginning of the
							project until April 1984. From 1984 through 2005, dissolved reactive silicon was
							determined on a Technicon Auto Analyzer II. From January 2006 to present, samples are
							run on an Astoria-Pacific Astoria II Autoanalyzer. total and dissolved nitrogen and
							phosphorus Samples for total and dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus analysis are
							collected together with a peristaltic pump and tubing and in-line filtered, when
							necessary, (through a 40 micron polycarbonate filter) into 120 ml LDPE bottles and
							acidified to a 1percent HCl matrix by adding 1 mL of ultra pure concentrated HCl to
							100 mls of sample. For every sample acidification event, three acid blanks are created
							by adding the same acid used on the samples to 100 mls of ultra pure water supplied
							from the lab. Once acidified, the samples are stable at room temperature until
							analysis, which should occur within one year. Until acidification, the samples should
							be refrigerated at 4 degrees Celsius. The samples must first be prepared for analysis
							by adding an NaOH&#226;&#128;&#147;Persulfate digestion reagent and heated for an hour at 120 degrees C
							and 18-20 psi in an autoclave. The samples are analyzed for total nitrogen and total
							phosphorus simultaneously by automated colorimetric spectrophotometry, using a
							segmented flow autoanalyzer. Total nitrogen is determined by utilizing the automated
							cadmium reduction method, as described in Standard Methods, where the absorption is
							monitored at 520 nm. The detection limit for total and dissolved nitrogen is
							approximately 21 ppb and the analytical range for the method extends to 2500 ppb. The
							detection limit for total phosphorus is approximately 3 ppb and the analytical range
							for the method extends to 800 ppb. Method Log: Prior to January 2006 samples, total
							nitrogen was determined on a Technicon segmented flow autoanalyzer. From 2006 to
							present, total nitrogen is determined by an Astoria-Pacific Astoria II segmented flow
							autoanalyzer. </para>
					</section>
					<section>
						<para>Ammonium, Nitrate, Nitrit Samples for ammonium and nitrate or nitrite are
							collected together with a peristaltic pump and tubing and in-line filtered (through a
							0.40 micron polycarbonate filter) into new, 20 ml HDPE plastic containers with conical
							caps. The samples are stored frozen until analysis, which should occur within 6
							months. The samples are analyzed for ammonium (and nitrateornitrite) simultaneously by
							automated colorimetric spectrophotometry, using a segmented flow autoanalyzer.
							Ammonium is determined by utilizing the Berthelot Reaction, producing a blue colored
							indophenol compound, where the absorption is monitored at 660 nm. The detection limit
							for ammonium is approximately 3 ppb and the analytical range for the method extends to
							4000 ppb. The detection limit for nitrateornitrite is approximately 2 ppb and the
							analytical range for the method extends to 4000 ppb. Method Log: Prior to January 2006
							samples, ammonium was determined on a Technicon segmented flow autoanalyzer. From 2006
							to present, ammonium is determined by an Astoria-Pacific Astoria II segmented flow
							autoanalyzer. pH We sample at the deepest part of the lake using a peristaltic pump
							and tubing, monthly during open water and approximately every five weeks during ice
							cover. We collect two types of pH samples at each sampling depth: one in 20ml vials
							with cone cap inserts to exclude all air from the vial, and one in 125ml bottles to be
							air equilibrated before analysis. The depths for sample collection are based on
							thermal stratification: top and bottom of the epilimnion, mid thermocline, and top,
							middle,and bottom of the hypolimnion. During mixis we sample at the surface, mid water
							column, and bottom. We analyze for pH the same day that samples are collected, keeping
							them cold and dark until just before analysis. Samples are warmed to room temperature
							in a dark container, and the air equilibrated samples are bubbled with outside air for
							at least 15 minutes prior to measurement. We measure pH using a Radiometer combination
							pH electrode and Orion 4Star pH meter. Protocol Log: 1981-1988 -- used a PHM84
							Research pH meter. 1986 -- began analyzing air equilibrated pH. 1988 - July 2010 --
							used an Orion model 720 pH meter. </para>

			<abstract>
				<para>North Temperate Lakes Long Term Ecological Research studies the ecology of lakes as
					one of a network of sites established by the National Science Foundation. We are
					interested in how biophysical setting, climate, and changing land use and cover interact
					to shape lake characteristics and dynamics over time (past, present, future). Our primary
					study sites include a set of seven northern Wisconsin and four southern Wisconsin lakes
					and their surrounding landscapes. The project, which started in 1981, is administered by
					the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Perception of Long-Term
					Change: How and why have the lake districts changed, and how will they change in the
					future? Climatic Forcing of Change: What are the major ecological and social responses of
					lake districts to climate change? Interacting Drivers, Scales of Space and Time, and
					Regional Change: How do multiple interacting drivers affect regional change in lake
					districts at multiple scales? Ecosystem Services: Past, Present and Future: What are the
					magnitudes, interactions and potential future flows of ecosystem services in lake
					districts? </para>
