              canopy of giant kelp was patchy at the beginning of the study and a lush assemblage of
              understory kelps (Pterygophora californica and Laminaria farlowii), and red algae
              (principally Chondracanthus corymbiferus and Rhodymenia californica) occupied the
              bottom underneath the gaps in the Macrocystis canopy. We measured primary production
              by understory algae and phytoplankton approximately monthly from May 2007 through
              September 2008 at two locations on the reef: at the offshore edge of the forest in a
              patch with sparse Macrocystis and a lush assemblage of understory macroalgae (area ~
              1000 m2) and at 30 m inshore of the offshore edge, under a dense Macrocystis canopy
              with a sparse understory assemblage. Macrocystis was beginning to re-invade the
              location at the offshore edge, and we forestalled this by removing Macrocystis in
              March 2007, two months before the study began and by maintaining this area clear of
              Macrocystis throughout the study period.</para><para>Both locations, referred to as the Macrocystis removal (MR) and Macrocystis
              control (MC) sites, were at similar depth and in areas of relatively flat, low-relief
              rock substrate. The large influence of Macrocystis on light and flow in the Mohawk
              kelp forest coupled with the close proximity and similar biological and physical
              features of the Macrocystis removal and Macrocystis control sites greatly reduced the
              chance that factors other than the presence of giant kelp would cause differences in
              NPP between the two sites.</para></section><section><title>Understory algal biomass, production, and community structure</title><para>Primary production by the understory algal assemblage was measured each month
              along permanent 30 m transects at both the Macrocystis control and Macrocystis removal
              sites. Primary production was estimated from oxygen evolution measured in
              tunnel-shaped closed chambers (25 cm wide x 40 cm long x 40 cm tall), that consisted
              of two U-shaped end walls made of clear rigid acrylic, with continuous side walls and
              ceiling made of flexible Teflon sheeting (Tefzel, DuPont) and an open bottom framed by
              fiberglass-reinforced plastic that was sealed to the sea floor by a nylon gasket and a
              weighted flexible plastic skirt (Miller et al. 2009). Observations using rhodamine dye
              indicated that this made a highly effective seal (Miller et al. 2009). The flexibile
              side walls and ceiling permitted wave energy to be transmitted through the walls of
              the chambers, allowing macrophytes inside to oscillate naturally with wave-generated
              flow (sensu Gust 1977; Yates and Halley 2003). Chamber volume was ~45 L, and was
              measured for each chamber for production calculations. Water circulation was provided
              with a battery-powered submersible pump to ensure mixing of oxygen and prevent
              mass-transfer limitation of algal photosynthesis, (Rule 500 baitwell pump, 1890 L
              h-1). Self-contained optical probes (D-Opto, ENVCO) within each chamber logged
              dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature inside the chambers at a frequency of
              once per minute.</para><para>Oxygen measurements were taken simultaneously in four chambers per sampling date.
              Two chambers were placed randomly by divers along the control and removal transects on
              the morning of each sampling date and incubated for the majority of the day to capture
              diurnal variability in production rates (10 hours March-November, 8 hours
              December-February). The placement of chambers along the transects differed on each
              sampling date such that no plot was sampled more than once during the study.
              Conditions within the chambers were alternated between ambient light and dark on an
              hourly basis with darkness created by draping blackout cloth over the chamber.
              Chambers were flushed with outside water after each pair of light and dark incubations
              (every 2 h) by opening two stoppered ports and using the circulation pump to exchange
              water for 10 minutes. Oxygen saturation levels inside the chambers never exceeded
              those of ambient seawater by more than 10%.</para><para>After all incubations for the day were complete, the biomass of macroalgae
              enclosed by the chambers was collected by gently scraping it from the bottom into a
              fine mesh bag. Macroalgae were separated from animals and other material in the
              laboratory and sorted by taxa. The algae were cleaned of animal epiphytes, blotted
              dry, weighed and then dried at 60oC and re-weighed to obtain dry weight. Subsamples of
              dried tissue of each algal taxon were ground and analyzed for carbon content, and
              these values were used to convert dry weight to carbon weight. To evaluate the
              potential for differences in nutrient availability between the Macrocystis removal and
              Macrocystis control sites, tissue samples from species of understory algae that were
              present within at least one chamber at both sites on the same date were also analyzed
              for carbon and nitrogen content using a Carlo-Erba (Flash EA 1112 series) automated
              organic elemental analyzer.</para><para>Production and respiration rates were calculated by plotting oxygen concentration
              over incubation time, fitting a linear regression line to the data, and using the
              regression equation to calculate hourly rates of oxygen change. Net community
              production (NCP) was estimated as oxygen production in the light incubation. We report
              estimates of NCP per 12 hour period, since we did not measure nighttime community
              respiration, which is likely to be lower and non-linearly related to daytime
              respiration (Barron and Duarte 2009). Oxygen consumption in the dark incubation was
              used as an estimate of community respiration (CR). Gross primary production (GPP) was
              calculated as the sum of oxygen produced in the light and that consumed by respiration
              in the dark, and GPP was converted to NPP using mass-specific respiration rates
              obtained in laboratory dark incubations of 11 of the common understory species
              representing &gt;97% of the understory biomass (R.J. Miller unpublished data). Briefly,
              algal specimens were collected and kept in running seawater, and within 1 day were
              incubated for 30 minutes in the dark to obtain respiration rates, after which the
              algae were dried at 60oC and weighed. For rare species that were not measured, average
              respiration rates of related species were used to estimate NPP. Middelboe et al.
              (2006) found that separate measurements of thallus respiration, weighted by biomass,
              accurately predicted community respiration in mixed-species heterotrophy-free algal
              assemblages. While we do not know the degree to which respiration in the light is
              different from respiration in the dark, the carbon-concentrating capacity of aquatic
              plants should minimize this difference (Falkowski and Raven, 2007). Direct measures of
              the effect of oxygen concentration on DIC uptake and compensation point in marine
              macroalgae have supported this view (Cook and Colman 1987).</para><para>NPP, NCP, and CR were integrated across the day for each plot, using daylengths
              calculated with sunrise and sunset times for each sampling date, and are expressed in
              mg C m-2 d-1, which was obtained using photosynthetic and respiratory quotients of 1,
              following Rosenberg et al. (1995), who found that PQ did not consistently relate to
              nutrient source or taxonomy and recommend using a value of 1 for the sake of
              inconvertibility when DIC uptake is not directly measured. Near-bottom rates of
              phytoplankton NPP were low, averaging less than 1% of benthic production, and were not
              corrected for, since measurements of phytoplankton and benthic algae were not
              simultaneous.</para></section><section><title>Phytoplankton biomass and production</title><para>Phytoplankton production was measured at the Macrocystis removal and Macrocystis
              control sites using in situ 13C-bicarbonate tracer incubations according to the
              methods of Shipe and Brzezinski (2003). Briefly, a pair of 500 mL polycarbonate light
              and dark bottles were filled with water collected at 5 depths (1, 2, 3, 4, 6 m) at
              each site (Macrocystis control and Macrocystis removal) using an 8-L Go-Flo bottle
              (General Oceanics). Following addition of 0.5 ml of 0.167 mol L-1 H13CO3- (99.9
              atom%), experimental bottles were incubated for ~24 h at each site on a moored line at
              the collection depths, placed in a dark cooler upon collection, and filtered through
              precombusted (450oC for 2 h) glass fiber filters. 13C atom percentage of the
              particulate matter was measured using a Thermo Finnigan Delta-Plus Advantage isotope
              mass spectrometer coupled with a Costech EAS elemental analyzer. Carbon fixation in
              the incubation bottles was calculated as:</para><para>where A%sam is atom percent 13C measured on the filtered sample after incubation,
              A%nat is the average natural abundance of 13C in suspended particulate organic carbon
              (POC, 1.112%, Fernandez et al. 2005), and A%enr is the atom percent 13C of the labeled
              substrate. POC0 is the pre-incubation concentration of POC (&#956;mol C L-1). Production
              was corrected for dark uptake, including any that occurred between collection and
              filtration, and integrated through the water column (to 6 m depth). 24-h carbon tracer
              uptake best represents NPP, although high heterotrophic activity during the night may
              lead to an underestimation of production (Marra 2009). POC and chlorophyll a (Chl a)
              concentrations (surrogates for phytoplankton biomass) were measured for each sampling
              depth. POC concentrations were measured in 630 mL water samples filtered through
              precombusted glass fiber filters and analyzed with a Leeman Labs (Model 440)
              carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen analyzer. Chl a was measured in 200 mL water samples filtered
              through 0.45 &#61549;m, 47 mm cellulose ester Millipore filters following Parsons et al.

            regions, the shallow rocky reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, are dominated
            by giant kelp forests. Because of their close proximity to shore, kelp forests are
            influenced by physical and biological processes occurring on land as well as in the open
            ocean. SBC LTER research focuses on measuring and modeling the patterns, transport, and
            processing of material constituents (e.g., nutrients, carbon, sediment, organisms, and
            pollutants) from terrestrial watersheds and the coastal ocean to these reefs.
            Specifically, we are examining the effects of these material inputs on the primary
