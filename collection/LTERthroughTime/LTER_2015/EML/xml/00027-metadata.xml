    <abstract>
      <para>E172 is an herbivory experiment established by Dave Tilman in fall 2004 by enclosing in deer fences three randomly selected plots from the six replicates of each control and each treatment in the N addition E001 experiment in field C. These plots still receive the nutrient treatments prescribed in the Experiment 001 protocols.  From 1982-2004 a fence containing all of e001 plots in Field C was designed to exclude deer and all small mammals, including mice, voles and pocket gophers. This fence was removed in Fall of 2004 and individual plots designated for e172 were enclosed in deer fences. 

The purpose of E001 was to measure how adding nitrogen over a long time would affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals.  There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients.  The plots are in a 6 by 9 grid and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots.  Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June.</para>

        <geographicDescription> The Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN. CCNHA lies at the boundary between prairie and forest. It is a mosaic of uplands dominated by oak savanna, prairie, hardwood forest, pine forests,and abandoned agricultural fields and of lowlands comprised of ash and cedar swamps, acid bogs, marshes, and sedge meadows. Large tracts of the pre-agricultural ecosystems of the region are preserved within its boundaries, as is a successional chronosequence of more than 80 old fields of known history.</geographicDescription>

                <para>The "microplot" fertilization treatments are used in experiments 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, 23, 25, and 52. Experiments 5, 6, 28, 36, 53, 97, 98, 100 and 172 are conducted within plots that are fertilized and should be treated as part of the fertilized plot. There are nine treatment levels, assigned a numeric label 1 to 9. This is also equivalent to the letters A through I.  Treatment levels 1 through 8 differ in the amount of NH4NO3 added. Treatment 9 is a true control and receives no nutrients. The nutrients are applied twice a year, once in early May and once in late June.  An exception is experiment 25 where time of application is experimentally manipulated. Not all experiments use all possible treatments. Nutrients are given in g/m2 for each fertilization; plot area and treatments used follow the nutrient lists. 

Treatment 1 to 8 receive the following base nutrients:

Rate	Volume	Element
10 g/m2	150 ml	P2O5 (0-46-0)
10 g/m2	150 ml	K2O (0-0-61)

15m2	200 ml	MgSO4 (Epsom Salts)

The amount of NH4NO3 fertilizer added at the different treatment levels is:

9  	0.0 g/m2  	0 ml@@

Fertilizer is mixed and spread by hand twice a year, once in early May and once in late June. Each plot gets the fertilizer mixture specified by its fertilizer treatment code. These rates are added twice a year. Actual annual N addition is calculated as:

0.34%N * rate (g/m2) * 2 times/year

The trace mineral stock solutions are made by adding the following grams of reagent to 1000 ml of water:

CuSO4*5H2O 9.8 g
ZnSO4*7H2O 22.0 g
or
ZnCl2 10.5 g
CoCl2*6H2O 10.0 g
MnCl2*4H2O 180.0 g
Na2MoO4*2H2O 6.3 g
H3BO3 6.0 g

The trace metal solution is made by combining 120ml of each stock solution, adding 67.2g of citric acid dissolved in deionized water and adding deionized water to bring the volume to a total of 2 liters. The working solution is then autoclaved to chelate the trace metals.

Some changes and/or additions occur from year to year for some experiments. These changes are listed below. Unless specific experiments are mentioned, these differences apply to all experiments in a category.

In 1982, 30ml of each stock solution was combined with 16.8g citric acid, brought to a total volume of 1 liter, and autoclaved to dissolve. 1.5ml of this solution was added to 30ml of silica sand, mixed and dried.

In 1983, 60ml of each stock solution was combined with 25g of EDTA brought to 1 liter, and autoclaved to dissolve. 1ml of this solution was added to 10ml of sand and added to each plot.

In 1984, 60ml of each stock solution was combined with 25g of citric acid and brought to 1 liter.

In 1985, the first fertilization for experiments 1 and 2,
Treatment F received an extra 23 g/m2 of CaCO3
Treatment G received an extra 118.5 g/m2 of CaCO3
Treatment H received an extra 132.5 g/m2 of CaCO3

In 1985, between fertilizations for experiments 1 and 2,
Treatment G received 137.5 g/m2 of CaCO3
Treatment H received 206.25 g/m2 of CaCO3

In 1985, the second fertilization for experiments 1 and 2,
Treatment F received an extra 23.0 g/m2 of CaCO3
Treatment G received an extra 252.7 g/m2 of CaCO3
Treatment H received an extra 441.1 g/m2 of CaCO3

In 1985, the first fertilization for experiment 4,
Treatment E received no CaCO3
Treatment G received an extra 45.5 g/m2 of CaCO3

In 1985, both fertilizations for experiments 8, 9, and 11,
Treatment F received an extra 23 g/m2 of CaCO3
Treatment G received an extra 43.5 g/m2 of CaCO3
Treatment H received an extra 57.5 g/m2 of CaCO3

In 1989, lime was added to adjust pH to the following treatments in the spring:

                <para>Experiment E001 plots were enclosed by a fence in 1982 to exclude mammalian herbivores. Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a depth of 84cm. Additional hardware cloth extended 60cm above the ground, and poultry netting extended to 1.8m above the ground. During the summer of 1986, aluminum flashing was placed in the ground to a depth of 12 inches. This flashing surrounded each plot, keeping the plants from spreading between plots by below-ground vegetative reproduction. The aluminum flashing was placed 12 inches from the edge of each plot. In fall 2004, herbivore exclosure fences were removed fields A, B, and D, and from all plots in field C except the following: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 37, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, and 53. These plots were designated for e172 and were enclosed in deer fences.</para>
