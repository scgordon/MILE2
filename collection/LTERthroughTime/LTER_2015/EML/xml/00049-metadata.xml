    <abstract>
      <para>Conductivity, temperature and pressure were measured continuously at Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER sampling location GCE9_Hydro (Altamaha River near Rockdedundy Island, Georgia) from  01-Jan-2003 through 31-Dec-2003. Observations were logged at 30 minute intervals by moored Sea-Bird Electronics MicroCAT 37-SM data loggers and downloaded approximately bimonthly. Salinity, depth and sigma-t were calculated from the measured parameters using standard UNESCO algorithms. This data set was collected as part of the GCE-LTER Project continuous salinity, temperature and water level monitoring program.</para>

            <title>Deployment</title>
            <para>The MicroCAT was mounted inside a protective PVC pipe enclosure and attached to a wooden piling (~12 inch diameter) that was driven firmly into the substrate.  The enclosure was constructed from a 10-foot length of 6-inch (internal diameter) PVC pipe that was perforated all over by drilling 1.5-inch holes (at approximately 4-inch spacing); this permits proper water circulation within the enclosure.  The bottom of the PVC pipe was submerged about 5 feet below the water surface at low tide and bolted (vertically) to the piling.  The MicroCAT was deployed by lowering it into the enclosure on a 0.375-inch stainless steel cable, and bolting the cable to the piling, so that the bottom of the data logger was ~3 inches above the bottom of the PVC pipe.  A weighted surveyor's tape was then used to measure the distance from the substrate to the pressure sensor on the MicroCAT for calculation of total water column depth from pressure readings.  The mooring was inspected every 1-3 weeks, and any visible fouling of the enclosure or MicroCAT was removed with a brush or scraper.</para>

            <para>At the end of the measurement period (approximately 2 months), the MicroCAT was unshackled from the cable and returned to the laboratory. The stored data was uploaded using a RS-232 serial cable and Sea-Bird Electronics SEATERM software.  The MicroCAT was then cleaned to remove encrusting material and calibrated with a reference instrument at 4 to 5 salinity levels, generally ranging from 30 to 5 PSU.</para>

            <para>Data were processed after each retrieval using custom programs in the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB (parse_37sm and imp_gcesonde). Depth was calculated from recorded pressure and latitude values, and salinity and sigma-t were calculated from recorded conductivity and temperature values using standard UNESCO algorithms (reference: Unesco. 1983. Algorithms for computation of fundamental properties of seawater, 1983. Unesco Technical Papers in Marine Science No. 44, 53 pp.). Data were then plotted and visually inspected for evidence of biofouling of the conductivity sensor (i.e. prolonged periods of damped tidal oscillation in conductivity signal with no corresponding changes in temperature signal and no  wind or rainfall events recorded at nearby monitoring stations, or periods of damped oscillation immediately followed by normal oscillation after instrument maintenance or replacement). Conductivity values recorded during periods of suspected biofouling were flagged as I (invalid) if visible fouling was noted in maintenance logs, and Q (questionable) if no visible fouling was noted.</para>

      <abstract>
        <para>We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.</para>

            <abstract>
              <para>The GCE Data Toolbox is a comprehensive library of functions for metadata-based analysis
quality control, transformation and management of ecological data sets. The toolbox is based on the GCE Data 
Structure, a MATLAB specification for storing tabular data along with all information required to interpret 
the data and generate formatted metadata (documentation). Metadata fields in the structure are queried 
by toolbox functions for all operations, allowing functions to process and format values appropriately 
based on the type of information they represent. This semantic processing approach supports highly 
automated and intelligent data analysis and ensures data set validity throughout all processing steps.</para>

            <para>Quality control analysis was performed using the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB software. Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column.</para>

            <abstract>
              <para>The GCE Data Toolbox is a comprehensive library of functions for metadata-based analysis
quality control, transformation and management of ecological data sets. The toolbox is based on the GCE Data 
Structure, a MATLAB specification for storing tabular data along with all information required to interpret 
the data and generate formatted metadata (documentation). Metadata fields in the structure are queried 
by toolbox functions for all operations, allowing functions to process and format values appropriately 
based on the type of information they represent. This semantic processing approach supports highly 
automated and intelligent data analysis and ensures data set validity throughout all processing steps.</para>

          <description>
            <para>Quality control analysis was performed using the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB software. Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column.</para>
