It has a warm and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance. Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Jean</givenName><surName>Lodge</surName></individualName><organizationName>USDA Forest Service</organizationName><positionName>Principal Investigator</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Forest Products Lab</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>PO Box 1377</deliveryPoint><city>Luquillo</city><administrativeArea>PR</administrativeArea><postalCode>00773-1377</postalCode><country>USA</country></address><phone phonetype="voice">(787)889-7445</phone><phone phonetype="fax">(787)889-7477</phone><electronicMailAddress>djlodge@caribe.net</electronicMailAddress></contact><publisher scope="document"><organizationName>Luquillo Experimental Forest LTER</organizationName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.

Percent cover is projected from 3 m height downward. Cover classes are: 0 (none), + (&gt;0-1%; &lt; 20 x 20 cm), 1(2% - 5%; &gt; 20 x 20 cm but &lt; 44 x 44 cm), 2 (6%-25%;&gt; 44 x 44 cm but &lt; 1 m2), 3 (26% - 50%; &gt; 1 m2 but &lt; 2 m2), 4 (51% - 75%; &gt; 2 m2 but 3 m2), and 5 (76% - 100%; &gt; 3 m2 to 4

1. Rocks (and boulders) 
2. Leaf litter (including dead palm fronds and all downed leaves) 
3. Twigs (&lt;1 cm diam.)

Summary of Plot Establishment: 

Sixty 2x2 m seedling and sapling plots were established during May of 1990 in the 9-ha grid by Francisco Calderon and 
Eduardo Flores. Plots are associated with appoximately every other grid pole, as described in the separate protocol 
instructions. Plots are representative of habitat frequencies, topographic locations and aspect, but plots with &gt; 50% bare 
boulders, stream beds or trails were rejected. The corners of each plot are marked with 2 1/2 foot long PVC poles with fuchsia 
pink tops. Nylon string was tied around the perimeter. The inner corner of the plot is set 1+1 m away (usually N and E) from 
the grid pole to avoid foot traffic, and is marked with an aluminum tag saying: Brokaw 9-ha seed/sap plot, LTER, June 1990 
plus the grid pole number. A 1/2 x 2m seedling subplot has been marked with nylon cord, beginning at the inner corner and 
oriented N-S. Flagging leading to plots is orange.</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep></methods><project scope="document"><title>Seedling and Sapling Dynamics</title><personnel scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Nicolas V.L.</givenName><surName>Brokaw</surName></individualName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><abstract><para><literalLayout>Studies of seedlings and saplings are and have been conducted on several landslides and plots on the LEF. The primary purposes are to study seedling recruitment and seedling and sapling growth and the effect of hurricane disturbance (specifically Hugo) on these processes as related to the degree of canopy disturbance, and the temporary reduction in shade from the defoliation of the canopy under distinct soil conditions.  9Ha Study  The primary purpose of this study is to look at seedling recruitment, and the growth of seedlings and saplings as it relates to the degree of canopy disturbance caused by Hurricane Hugo. Although all trees down to 1-cm dbh will eventually be identified and measured for the separate 16-ha grid project, the smallest trees will not be measured for at least a year, and seedling will not be included in the 16-ha grid program. The seedling/sapling plots in the 9-ha grid will allow us to follow early responses of seedlings and saplings to increased light. Tree maps for the 16-ha grid which will encompass the 9-ha grid) will eventually be used to determine the proximity of seed-source trees to each plot.  Treefall Pits Study  (1) how does the soil physical environment differ between the soil pit and the forest floor?; (2) do tree species that have N-fixing symbionts influence soil nutrients or species composition of colonizers?, and (3) what are the consequences of uprooting and defoliation for populations of seedlings and saplings and for tree recruitment?</literalLayout></para></abstract><funding><para><literalLayout>LTER</literalLayout></para></funding></project><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=LUQ,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>9hcover.txt</entityName><entityDescription>Wood fall from Hurricane Hugo &#226;&#8364;&#8220; 9ha Grid</entityDescription><physical scope="document"><objectName>9hcover.txt</objectName><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><recordDelimiter>\n</recordDelimiter><physicalLineDelimiter>\n</physicalLineDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://luq.lternet.edu/data/lterdb40/data/9hcover.txt</url></online></distribution></physical><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><references>geoReference</references></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage id="temporalReference9hcover.txt" scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1990-06-06</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1993-11-05</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><method><methodStep><description><para><literalLayout>Visual estimate of cover of the various parameters
