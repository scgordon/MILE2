In the event of contamination of either collector, the chemistry is used only from the clean site. 
      Daily deposition values (in g/ha-mo) are derived by multiplying daily precipitation amounts (in mm) for Watershed 6, by the average weekly concentration of solutes from the bulk collectors (in mg/L) for the same period. Daily values are summed to produce monthly deposition, and deposition divided by total monthly precipitation to produce volume-weighted, average monthly concentrations for precipitation at HBEF WS-6.</literalLayout></para></section></description><citation scope="document"><title>The calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium budgets for a small forested ecosystem.</title><creator id="likens" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>G.E.</givenName><surName>Likens</surName></individualName></creator><creator id="bormann" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>F.H.</givenName><surName>Bormann</surName></individualName></creator><creator id="johnson" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>N.M.</givenName><surName>Johnson</surName></individualName></creator><creator id="pierce" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>R.S.</givenName><surName>Pierce</surName></individualName></creator><pubDate>1967</pubDate><language>english</language><article><journal>Ecology</journal><volume>48</volume><issue>5</issue><pageRange>772-785</pageRange></article></citation><citation scope="document"><title>Atmospheric contributions to water quality of streams in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire</title><creator id="fisher" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>D.W.</givenName><surName>Fisher</surName></individualName></creator><creator id="gambell" scope="document"><individualName><givenName>A.W.</givenName><surName>Gambell</surName></individualName></creator><creator scope="document"><references>likens</references></creator><creator scope="document"><references>bormann</references></creator><pubDate>1968</pubDate><article><journal>Water Resour.

Data are used only to calculate deposition for HBEF Watershed 6. 
      Base cations are available since 1963; ammonium, pH, and anions since 1964. Aluminum and chloride data from before 1967 may have been contaminated by collectors screened during summer seasons, so that average monthly values have not been calculated. From 1963 to 1969, precipitation data were compiled in combined files representing several collectors located throughout HBEF. After June 1969, average bulk precipitation collections from RG-11 and/or RG-1 are recorded in this separate file.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>These data are physically located at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Robert S.
