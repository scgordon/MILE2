continuos addition of the conservative tracer, sodium bromide, to
the channel at an upstream site.  Additionally, the concentration

550 meters downstream of the fertilization point.
Well Construction/Installation:  Hyporheic samplers consisted of 
a 1/8 inch O.D. stainless steel (S.S.) tube housed in a 3/4 inch 
CPVC pipe.  At the lower end of the CPVC a rubber stopper was 
inserted with the S.S tube protruding ten centimeters.  A coupler 
was then used to attach a length of well screen to protect the 
S.S. tube.  Tygon tubing was slid onto the top end of the S.S 
tubing and a three-way Pharmaseal stopcock was inserted into the 
tubing.  Samplers were inserted into the stream bed by forcing a 
pry bar into the stream bed  to a depth of the maximum depth 
allowed, typically 30-60 centimeters.  The sampler was then 
worked down into the hole and the pry bar removed, allowing the 
hole to cave in onto the sampler.  The length of the sampler, 
still above the substrate, was measured and subtracted from the 
total length to find the depth of the sampler in the substrate.  
Samplers were allowed to settle before any testing occurred.
Sample collection:  Samples were collected via a 60 mL syringe 
directly from the sampler after drawing 30 mL out to purge the 
interior of the sampler. Samples were filtered through a 25 mm 
diameter 0.45 um  cellulose acetate syringe filter in the field.
Sample analysis:  Specific conductivity was measured in the field 
on a VWR model 2052 conductivity meter.  All sample analysis was 
done within 24 hours of collection and stored cold during the 
interim period.  Ammonia-nitrogen concentrations were determined 
by the phenate method.  Nitrate-nitrogen was determined by 
cadmium reduction.  Phosphate-phosphorous was determined by the 
ascorbic acid method. Samples were analyzed for their bromide 
concentration by HPLC on a Dionex AS4A Anion column.
Carbon dioxide and methane were measured directly by 
equilibration of the sample with ambient air.  The head-space air 
was then analyzed by thermal conductivity for CO2 and flame 
ionization for CH4.  Concentrations were corrected for ambient 
concentrations, depth, temperature, and pH.</literalLayout></para><para><literalLayout>Notes: The variable, D/D for River distance is in 
reference to the top of the riffle and the established river 
markings.  Use the X and Y coordinates (river right to left and 
distance downstream) for more detailed positions.
