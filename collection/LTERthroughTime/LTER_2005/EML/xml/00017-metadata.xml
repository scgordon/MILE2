One plots each is in tabonuco forest (350 m elevation), colorado forest (650 m) and cloud forest (1000 m). The first records were made shortly before Hurricane Hugo, in 1989. Post hurricane measurements have been made five time to six time in each plot, the most recent been in 1998 for all plots. The results show the damage to forest structure wreaked bye Hurricane Hugo, steady recovery of forest structure after Hugo, minor damage by Hurricane Hortense in 1996, and resumption of recovery after Hortense. Maximum canopy height and the vertical distribution of vegetation in the forests are returning to pre-hurricane Hugo values.</literalLayout></para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>LUQ</keyword><keyword>Luquillo</keyword><keyword>canopy height</keyword><keyword>colorado forest</keyword><keyword>tabonuco forest</keyword><keyword>cloud forest</keyword><keyword>CLOUD FOREST</keyword><keyword>COLORADO</keyword><keyword>TABONUCO</keyword><keyword>DISTURBANCE</keyword><keyword>HIGHER PLANTS</keyword><keyword>PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL</keyword></keywordSet><intellectualRights><section><title>ADEQUATE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><para><literalLayout>The scientists, the LEF-LTER Program, and the USDA International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF) must receive adequate acknowledgement for the use of data by other scientists, and the LEF LTER program must receive two copies of any publication using that data.

It has a warm and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance. Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments which are still followed closely.</geographicDescription><boundingCoordinates><westBoundingCoordinate>-65.92</westBoundingCoordinate><eastBoundingCoordinate>-65.7</eastBoundingCoordinate><northBoundingCoordinate>18.35</northBoundingCoordinate><southBoundingCoordinate>18.23</southBoundingCoordinate><boundingAltitudes><altitudeMinimum>20</altitudeMinimum><altitudeMaximum>1060</altitudeMaximum><altitudeUnits>meter</altitudeUnits></boundingAltitudes></boundingCoordinates></geographicCoverage></coverage><contact scope="document"><individualName><givenName>Nicolas V.L.</givenName><surName>Brokaw</surName></individualName><organizationName>University of Puerto Rico</organizationName><positionName>LUQ LTER Director</positionName><address scope="document"><deliveryPoint>Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Studies (ITES)</deliveryPoint><deliveryPoint>P.O.

One one-time goal was to measure the dimensions of gaps present at El Verde research area, and the other continuing goal is to record changes in three dimensional canopy structure in three one- hectare sized plots, one each in tabonuco, colorado, and cloud forests.  Area = p LW/4 (Runkle 1992). Only openings &amp;sup3; 20 m2; were counted as gaps.  The presence or absence of vegetation in height intervals above ground at points in the plots is recorded approximately every two years. We can then construct a three dimensional map of canopy surface and two- dimensional diagrams of vegetation cover along the vertical profile. The study began in 1989, before Hurricane Hugo, and continues, showing the changes caused by hurricane damage and recovery.</literalLayout></para></abstract><funding><para><literalLayout>LTER</literalLayout></para></funding></project><access authSystem="knb" order="allowFirst" scope="document"><allow><principal>uid=LUQ,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access><dataTable scope="document"><entityName>CLOUD-A1.txt</entityName><entityDescription>Vegetation profile and canopy height of cloud after Hurricane Hugo 1</entityDescription><physical scope="document"><objectName>CLOUD-A1.txt</objectName><dataFormat><textFormat><numHeaderLines>1</numHeaderLines><recordDelimiter>\n</recordDelimiter><physicalLineDelimiter>\n</physicalLineDelimiter><attributeOrientation>column</attributeOrientation><simpleDelimited><fieldDelimiter>,</fieldDelimiter></simpleDelimited></textFormat></dataFormat><distribution scope="document"><online><url function="download">http://luq.lternet.edu/data/lterdb21/data/CLOUD-A1.txt</url></online></distribution></physical><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><references>geoReference</references></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage id="temporalReferenceCLOUD-A1.txt" scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>1989-11-01</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>1989-11-01</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage><method><methodStep><description><para><literalLayout>Vegetation heigh profile and canopy heights are being constructed from data taken on 5 x 5 m grid systems in the tabonuco forest (in the southwest corner of  the 9 ha grid at El Verde), colorado forest (a couple of hundred meters from theshelter nearest the eastern end of the Tradewinds Trail), and in cloud forest (near the trail leading to the plane reck on the Pico del Oeste).

The tabonuco grid is 1.08 ha, with 475 grid points; the others are one ha. each, with 451 grid points each. The presence or absence of vegetation (leaves or wood) within height intervals along vertical line above each point in the grid is recorded. Vegetation "hits" on the line are recorded with a pole held vertically and marked at 0.5 m intervals to 3.0 m. The height of the vegetation above 3.0 m is estimated, and checked with an "optical tapemeasure".</literalLayout></para></description></methodStep><sampling><studyExtent><coverage scope="document"><geographicCoverage scope="document"><references>geoReference</references></geographicCoverage><temporalCoverage scope="document"><references>temporalReferenceTABON-B.txt</references></temporalCoverage></coverage></studyExtent><samplingDescription><section><para><literalLayout>once</literalLayout></para></section></samplingDescription></sampling></method><attributeList><attribute scope="document"><attributeName>Site of measurement</attributeName><attributeLabel>SITE</attributeLabel><attributeDefinition>type of forest where the observation is performed.
