         <section>
            <para>Plantations have been part of forestry at Harvard Forest since its beginning.  Plantations were established from 1911-1944, usually on open or cut-over land.  The objectives for plantation forests at Harvard Forest were to: increase amount of productive forest land; examine the suitability of various species and cultivars to New England conditions; and test planting and tending methods.  At first, mainly small plantings (less than 1 to 4 acres) were established primarily on "blank" lands.  Some larger plantations (20+ acres) were established on cut-over land around 1930.</para>
            <para>The bulk of the plantings were red pine, white pine and spruce (white and Norway), but several other conifers were also planted.  The maximum amount of land in plantations came to about 270 acres (less than 10% of Harvard Forest&#8217;s land base).  Tending of the plantations, especially weeding in the decade following establishment, but also in-filling, pruning and thinning, was conducted and carefully documented.  However, tending of plantations ceased about 1950.</para>
            <para>Since then, the fate of the plantations has been mixed.  Some plantations were out-competed by native forest with only scattered planted trees remaining.  A few acres of plantations were harvested in the 1950s.  About 40 acres of plantations were harvested in the 1990s.  As of 2007, approximately 135 acres remained.  These stands range in age from 60-90 years old.  Some stands have substantial areas blown down.  We developed a management plan to harvest about 80 acres of mature plantation forests beginning in 2008 in order to terminate these long term experiments, to regenerate a diversity of native tree species and restore native forests to these sites, and to initiate a new suite of long term experiments. For the next 10-15 years, the harvested areas will provide early successional habitat for a variety of wildlife species.</para>
            <para>A suite of permanent vegetation plots was established throughout the plantations to assess vegetation structure in plantations and predict future dynamics in harvested and early seral habitats. An initial objective of the baseline survey was to characterize current tree regeneration and understory flora that will in large part determine the future composition of these forests as the overstory is harvested or senesces.</para>

               <section>
                  <para>Study Design: A set of 22, 20m by 20m permanent plots were established.  Plots were placed in red pine and spruce dominated plantations, and in both harvest and control (no harvest) sites.  The number of plots per plantation is proportional to plantation area. Sites less than 10 acres contain one plot. There are two plots in a 13.5-acre unharvested red pine plantation; two plots in a harvested 13.5 acre spruce plantation; five plots in a somewhat heterogenous 38-acre harvested pine plantation. Altogether, there are 4 cut pine sites covering ~53 acres, 5 control pine sites covering ~26 acres, 2 cut spruce sites covering 16 acres, and 2 control spruce sites covering ~7 acres. Plots were established and measured in 2007, prior to harvest. Follow-up measurements were recorded within one year of harvest for the harvested plots only. In 2012, all 22 plots were re-measured.</para>
                  <para>Trees: Live stems at least 2.5cm dbh were tallied in the 20x20m plot by species. Live saplings more than1.3m tall but less than 2.5cm dbh were tallied by species in a 5.64 radius plot (100m2) centered on each plot.</para>
                  <para>Seedlings: Presence/absence of tree seedlings (less than 1.3m tall) by species was recorded in 10, 1.13m radius (4m2) plots in each plot, and frequency calculated. This measure of stocking is often considered more useful than total densities of tree seedlings, as this metric gives some indication of how well-distributed tree regeneration is on the site.</para>
                  <para>Understory vegetation: A list of shrubs, herbs, ferns, lycopods and graminoids (very roughly) occurring on each 20x20m plot was compiled, and abundance was estimated for each species using the following cover classes: 1 is less than 1% cover, 2 is 1-3% cover, 3 is 3-5% cover, 4 is 6-15% cover, 5 is 16-25% cover, 6 is 26-50% cover, 7 is 51-75% cover, 8 is more than 75% cover.</para>
                  <para>Coarse Woody Debris (CWD): Two transects running diagonally across each plot were established. The diameter, species (or species group) and decay class of each downed piece of wood that intersects the line-transect was measured using a 50cm caliper.  Minimum average diameter = 7.5cm. When possible, two diameter measurements are taken, to account for the fact that most stems are not uniformly round. From there we can calculate volume per unit area by using the formula V= 9.869* (d /8L), where L is length and d is diameter squared (ReHarmon, M.E. and J. Sexton. 1996. Guidelines for measurements of woody detritus in forest ecosystems. Not a formal publication).</para>
                  <para>Snags (standing dead trees) within the entire 20m x 20m plot were measured if at least 10cm dbh</para>
                  <para>Stump volume was estimated in the harvested plots in 2010 and 2012, by recording the species, diameter, height and decay class of each stump found within the plot. Minimum stump diameter was 10 cm.</para>
                  <para>Browsing: In 2008, browsing presence/absence by stem was surveyed in the 22 plots. Twenty-five 4m2 subplots were established in each plot, so 25% of each plot was assessed. Woody tree and shrub stems (excluding Rubus) between 0.3-3.0m tall and less than 5cm diameter were included. While moose browsing can be distinguished from deer browsing when tall (greather than 2m) or large (perhaps more than 0.5cm diameter) twigs are browsed, and these were noted, there were too few of these large saplings sampled to clearly distinguish between moose and deer browse. A complementary exclosure experiment by Faison et al. has been established in four harvested plantations to tease apart eh effects of deer vs. moose browsing, and to better quantify their long-term influences on forest structure and composition.</para>
