		<para>The purpose of this experiment is to measure how adding nitrogen over a long time will affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals. The experiment is being conducted within fields (A, B, C, and D) which were initially low in soil nutrients. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. There are 6 replicates of the 9 treatments in fields A, B, and C and 5 replicates in field D. The treatments were randomly assigned to the plots. In fields A, B, and C the plots are in 6 by 9 grids and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. In field D the plots are 1.5 by 4 meters and are placed in a 3 by 17 grid. The plots are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. Nitrogenfertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. This experiment was begun in 1982 by David Tilman.</para>

			<geographicDescription> The Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN. CCNHA lies at the boundary between prairie and forest. It is a mosaic of uplands dominated by oak savanna, prairie, hardwood forest, pine forests,and abandoned agricultural fields and of lowlands comprised of ash and cedar swamps, acid bogs, marshes, and sedge meadows. Large tracts of the pre-agricultural ecosystems of the region are preserved within its boundaries, as is a successional chronosequence of more than 80 old fields of known history.</geographicDescription>

								<para>The plots in experiment E001 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores. Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a depth of 84cm. Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground, and poultry netting extends to 1.8m above the ground. During the summer of 1986, aluminum flashing was placed in the ground to a depth of 12 inches. This flashing surrounds each plot in each field, keeping the plants from spreading between plots by below-ground vegetative reproduction. The aluminum flashing is placed 12 inches from the edge of each plot. In fall 2004, herbivore exclosure fences were removed from fields A, B, and D, and from all plots in field C except the following: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 37, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, and 53.</para>

								<para>We collected soil and litter samples from all eight study sites in May, July, and September of 2005.  Randomly located soil samples were collected using a 2 cm diameter x 10 cm deep soil corer.  The litter layer (O horizon) overlying each soil core was collected from within a 20 cm x 20 cm sampling frame centered over each soil core.  Four litter and four soil samples were collected and composited per plot.  Soil samples were mixed and passed through a 2mm sieve and litter samples were homogenized by mixing and shredding litter by hand prior to subsampling and analysis.  Samples for enzyme assays were frozen at -10 &#176;C for 2-12 months until time of analysis.</para>

							<listitem>
								<para>The "microplot" fertilization treatments are used in experiments 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, 23, 25, and 52. Experiments 5, 6, 28, 36,53,97, 98 and 100 are conducted within plots that are fertilized and should be treated as part of the fertilized plot.  There are nine treatment levels, assigned a letter A through I. This is also equivalent to the numeric labels 1 to 9. Treatment levels A through H differ in the amount of NH4NO3 added. Treatment I is a true control and receives no nutrients. The nutrients are applied twice a year, once in early May and once in late June. An exception is experiment 25 where time of application is experimentally manipulated. Not all experiments  use all possible treatments. Nutrients are given in g/m2 for each fertilization; plot area and treatments used follow the nutrient lists. 
 
Treatment A to H receive the following base nutrients: 
	 	 	 
Rate	Volume	Element 
10 g/m2	150 ml	P2O5 (0-46-0) 
10 g/m2	150 ml	K2O (0-0-61) 
20 g/m2	200 ml	CaCO3 (lime) 
15m2	200 ml	MgSO4 (Epsom Salts) 
0.0625 ml/m2	trace mineral solution in 1 ml to 10 ml sand	 	 	 
 
The description for making trace mineral sand is at the end of this section. 
 
The amount of NH4NO3 fertilizer added at the different treatment levels is: 
	 	 	 
Treatment	Rate	Volume 
A	0.0 g/m2	0 ml 
B  	1.5 g/m2  	25 ml 
C  	3.0 g/m2  	50 ml 
D  	5.0 g/m2  	90 ml 
E  	8.0 g/m2  	140 ml 
F  	14.0 g/m2  	250 ml 
G  	25.0 g/m2  	445 ml 
H  	40.0 g/m2  	710 ml 
I  	0.0 g/m2  	0 ml	 	 	 
 
These rates are added twice a year. Actual annual N addition is calculated as: 
 
0.34%N * rate (g/m2) * 2 times/year 
 
The trace mineral stock solutions are made by adding the following grams of reagent to 1000 ml of water: 
 
CuSO4*5H2O 9.8 g 
ZnSO4*7H2O 22.0 g 
or 
ZnCl2 10.5 g 
CoCl2*6H2O 10.0 g 
MnCl2*4H2O 180.0 g 
Na2MoO4*2H2O 6.3 g 
H3BO3 6.0 g 
 
The trace metal solution is made by combining 120ml of each stock solution, adding 67.2g of citric acid dissolved in deionized water and adding deionized water to bring the volume to a total of 2 liters. The working solution is then autoclaved to chelate the trace metals. 
 
The size of the plots and treatments used for each experiment are: 
	 	 	 
Experiment	Treatments	Plot size (m2) 
Experiment 1 except Field D	A thru I  	16 
Experiment 1 Field D	A thru I  	6 
Experiment 2  	A thru I  	16 
Experiment 4  	E, G, I  	1000 
Experiment 8  	C, F, H, I  	16 
Experiment 9  	C, F, H, I	16 
Experiment 11  	E, G, I	16 
Experiment 24  	E, G, I	16 
Experiment 25  	E, G, I	5.25 
Experiment 52	A, C, F, G	25</para>
